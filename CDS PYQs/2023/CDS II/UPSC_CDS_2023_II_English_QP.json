S1: The equatorial zone is generally an area of abundant precipitation (over 200 centimetres annually). S6: It is to be noted that a larger part of the precipitation in this region. falls as heavy intermittent convective showers accompanied by thunder and lightning. P: The ascending air currents become intensified locally in the tropical storms that produce abundant precipitation in the Caribbean, the southwest Pacific Ocean, the Indian Ocean and the China Sea. Q: Over the land areas, most of the precipitation occurs from the thunderstorms that are very frequent and active in the equatorial regions.
