      "explanation": "The Revolt of 1857 gave a severe jolt to the British administration in India and made its re-organization inevitable. The Government of India\u2019s structure and policies underwent significant changes after the Revolt.\n\n**Changes in Administration:** By the Act of Parliament of 1858, the power to govern India was transferred from the East India Company to the British Crown. The authority over India was now to be exercised by a Secretary of State for India aided by a Council.\n\nThe Indian Council Act of 1861 enlarged the Governor\u2019s Council for the purpose of making laws, which was known as the Imperial Legislative Council.\n\n**Provincial Administration:** The British had divided India for administrative convenience into provinces, three of which- Bengal, Bombay and Madras-were known as Presidencies. The Presidencies were administered by a Governor and his Executive Council of three, who were appointed by the Crown.\n\n**Changes in the army:** The domination of the army by its European branch was carefully guaranteed. The proportion of Europeans to Indians in the army was raised. The crucial branches of artillery, tanks and armored corps were put exclusively in European hands. The Indians were strictly excluded from the higher posts.\n\n**Divide and Rule:** Immediately after the revolt they suppressed Muslims, confiscated their lands and property on a large scale, and declared Hindus to be their favorite. After 1870, this policy was reversed and an attempt was made to turn Muslims against the nationalist movement. The Government cleverly used the attraction of government service to create a split between the educated Hindus and Muslims.\n\n**Relations with Princely States:** Loyalty of **Princely States** was now rewarded with the announcement that their right to adopt heirs would be respected and the integrity of their territories guaranteed against future annexation.\n\nThe officials became hostile to the educated Indians when the latter began to organise a nationalist movement among the people and founded the Indian National Congress.\n\nThe lands of most of the *talukdars* of *Awadh* were restored to them. The zamindars and landlords were now hailed as the traditional and \u2018natural\u2019 leaders of the Indian people. Their interest and privilege were protected and they, in turn, became the firm supporters of British rule in India.\n\nHence, in essence, uprising in 1857 was an important mark from which the British government started consolidating its hold over India, with an aim of having long lasting empire.",

      "explanation": "The freedom struggle in India symbolized a cauldron in which various sections of society contributed according to their potential to create a flavor of nationalism. In this context the role of women is very significant. The role of women in national movement evolved through various stages during which they were awarded different roles. Initially stages, the literati portrayed **Indian women as \u2018Mother\u2019** and linked it to **\u2018Bharat Mata\u2019** (in Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyaya\u2019s Anand Nath). The reform movements of 19th century presented the image of Ideal mother, Ideal wife and Ideal sister.\n\nWomen\u2019s active participation in mass movements began with the Swadeshi Movement in 1905 and only grew in later movements. Gandhiji accorded special role to women in NCM and CDM. He glorified their strength despite accepting their biological and social limitations. During Gandhian struggles the image of women changed from **motherhood to sisterhood**. To inspire confidence in them, Gandhiji presented examples of **Sita** and **Damayanti**. Some of women leaders during Gandhian struggle are as follows:\n\n* **Anusuya Ben \u2014** Accompanied gandhiji in his tours and actively participated in 1918 Ahmedabad Textile milk strikes.\n* **Sarojini Naidu \u2014** Led the raid on Dharasana salt works during civil movement following gandhiji arrest along with his son Manilal.\n* **Mridula Sarabai \u2014** A Gandhian who worked with Vanara Sena (Organised by Indira Gandhi).\n* **Besant \u2014** Helped Gandhiji organised Rowlatt Satyagrahs through Home Rule Leagues.\n\nIn addition to these Gandhian leaders, women also participated in freedom struggle in other capacities:\n\n* **Revolutionary Extremists \u2014** Kalpana Dutta (Chittagong Armoury raid), Bina Das/shot Bengal governor point blank, Durga Bhabhi/member of HSRA) etc.\n* **Women during Quit India Movement \u2014** Usha Mehta (Congress Radio), Sucheta Kriplani/Underground movement) etc.\n* Indian National Army\u2019s Rani Jhansi regiment led by Lakshmi Swaminadhan (Sehgal).",

    "solution": {
      "explanation": "Though the demand for linguistic states precedes India\u2019s independence, it was resisted by national leaders in the early years of independence. It was feared that demand for separate states along linguistic lines would endanger the unity of the young nation. It was felt that linguistic states may foster separatism and create pressures on the newly founded nation.\n\nHowever, the prophets of gloom and doom have been disproved. Linguistic states have strengthened not weakened Indian unity. It did not lead to the disintegration of the country as was feared. By accepting linguistic claims of all regions, the threat of division and separatism was reduced. The linguistic states underlined the acceptance of the principle of diversity. By embracing democracy, India did not merely adopt this format of elections, but it was a choice in favour of recognizing and accepting the existence of difference which could at times be oppositional. By reorganizing states on linguistic lines, a major grievance and source of discord was removed which could have led to separatist tendencies.\n\nFurther, linguistic states have in no manner adversely affected the federal structure of the union. The central government wields as much authority as it did before. If anything, national government has been strengthened by the creation of coherent state units which could be administered through a medium that the vast majority of the population understands.\n\nIn hindsight, instead of being a force of division, language has proved to be a cementing and integrating influence.",

    },
    "solution": {
      "explanation": "The anti colonial struggles in West Africa as response to European imperialism assumed both violent and non-violent form of resistance and spanned from late nineteenth century to mid twentieth century. The form of resistance depended upon number of factors - influence of religion, nature of the colony, degree of imperialism etc.\n\nThe role of intellectuals in the freedom struggle in various phases stood out as beacon of hope for later movements (apartheid in South Africa in second half of twentieth century). One of the outstanding figures in West Africa colonial struggle was Samouri Toure. He created large Mandinka Empire in West Africa and his struggle is a significant example of pragmatic resistance against French. He manufactured firearms, relocated his kingdom and engaged in diplomacy with both French and British.\n\nAnother form of resistance continued alongside violent resistance i.e. , the use of propaganda through press and literature by intellectuals. J.T. Jabavu established the press \u2018Native opinion\u2019 (Imvozaba NTsundu) through which Black south Africans expressed their opinions. The \u2018Lagos weakly Record\u2019 was founded by John Payne Jackson, an America-Liberian journalist who was influential in Lagos, Nigeria in 19th\u201320th Century.\n\nBesides press, the African intelligentsia also used societies, clubs and associations as vehicles for arising consciousness and disseminating information. The Gold Coast Aborigines Rights Protection Society (APRS) was one was one such associations formed in 1880s. In 1898 the ARPS successfully sent a petition to London to address issues with land Bill, and later for repealing the Town council ordinance. Another important organization founded in twentieth century was the \u2018National Congress of British west Africa\u2019 located in the gold cost which consisted of mostly African intellectual.",

    "solution": {
      "explanation": "Poverty is a state of being where a section of the society is unable to fulfill even its basic necessities of life. They are deprived of food, clothing, shelter and income. This is rooted in the underlying structural inequities in the economy and the inherent disadvantages arising out of social impediments such as lack of education, poor health etc. Therefore, to eradicate poverty, it is essential to liberate the poor from the process of deprivation. This can be done by providing them education, equipping them with skills to sustain a livelihood and providing them health care services to make them physically fit also to work. At the same time, to absorb them into the labour force, there has to be adequate number of job opportunities\u2014without which all the efforts will be a waste.\n\nRecognising this, the government policies have shifted away from traditional poverty alleviation schemes to a more multipronged approach to end this process of deprivation. There have been programmes and policies like\u2014\n\n* **Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act \u2014** it aims to enhance the livelihood security of people in rural areas by guaranteeing hundred days of wage-employment in a year to adult members of a rural household.\n* **Right to Education Act \u2014** to provide free and compulsory education to all children in the age group of 6-14 years.\n* **Skill India Mission \u2014** to rapidly implement and scale up skill development efforts across India.\n* **National Health Mission \u2014** to provide universal access to equitable, affordable and quality health care service across rural and urban areas.\n* **Make in India** initiative, attracting FDI, promoting entrepreneurship through start-up India to create jobs in the country.\n\nThe steps taken by the government are in the right direction and will go a long way in ending the process of deprivation if implemented effectively.",

      "explanation": "India is estimated to have nearly 14,500 km of navigable inland waterways, even though the exploitation of sector has remained neglected as most waterways in the country require constant dredging on account of heavy silting and draft is available only seasonally.\n\nIn the European Union it is 44 per cent. Inland waterways transportation in India, however, is a paltry 3 per cent. The number of vessels carrying cargo that ply on inland waterway systems in China and the EU are 2,00,000 and 11,000, respectively, while there are less than 1,000 vessels estimated to be using the Indian inland waterway systems. The crucial difference being that these countries have maintained and upgraded their river systems on core routes that can support large modern vessel fleets up to 40,000 tonnes of cargo on a single voyage, even as India is struggling to create depth in its river systems for vessels of 1,500 tonnage to go through. Even in Bangladesh, about 35 per cent of the freight movement is by inland waterways, according to ADB figures.\n\n**Problems of Inland Water Transport**\n\n* There is a seasonal fall in water level in rivers especially in the rain-fed rivers of the peninsula which become nearly dry during summer.\n* Reduced flow due to diversion of water for irrigation, for instance, in the Ganga which makes it difficult even for steamers to ply.\n* There is reduced navigability due to siltation, as in the Bhagirathi-Hooghly and in the Buckingham Canal.\n* There are problems in smooth navigation because of waterfalls and cataracts. For example, in rivers like Narmada and Tapti.\n* Salinity, especially in the coastal stretches, affects navigation.\n\nIndia should cash on its huge inland river network by addressing the above problems to save huge energy, time and environment costs (pollution)which it incurs on transport through road and rail network.",

    "solution": {
      "explanation": "The 1991 Liberalisation, Privatisation and Globalisation reforms were a watershed moment in the history of the country. The reforms were calculated, deliberative and piece-meal instead of being knee-jerk. This allowed the progress of the reforms to be modified as per the needs of the economy. For example \u2013 the gradual opening up of the economy to FDI continues even till current financial year. This facilitated competition and at the same time allowed domestic industries to grow and mature.\n\nThe reforms initially faced opposition and resistance cutting across party line. India therefore had to enforce these reforms within the contours of democracy by accommodating diverse interests. As a result the pace of the reforms was slow. This in contrast to China which being a communist country performed much better within the same span of time. But as and when there was favourable political mandate and support, the reforms were carried forward.\n\nAt the same time, the reforms were criticized as being biased towards the rich, reducing employment opportunities in organized sector, benefitting only a few sectors, especially services and therefore resulting in skewed development. The manufacturing and agricultural sectors did not reap much benefit and this continues even till today.\n\nHence, for the government to be responsive to this important change, it needs to focus on inclusive growth and development. This can be facilitated by carrying out second generation reforms which will be much deeper and all pervasive. The impediments to a speedy enforcement of GST tax reforms like Direct Tax Code and land reforms etc. should be removed at the earliest.",

Some of the measures taken by the government to achieve this are as follows:\n\n* Setting up of National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC) under Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana to offer meaningful, industry-relevant, skill based training to the Indian youth as well as a government certification on successful completion of training to help them secure a job in future.\n* Along with the Right to Education Act, a number of Scholarship schemes are in operation to encourage enrolment and learning levels among different groups.\n* Initiated the National Literacy Mission to raise the literacy rate to 80 percent and reduce the gender gap to less than 10 percent.\n* The National Policy on Education, 1986 emphasises is on removal of disparity among different social classes by ensuring equality of educational opportunities.\n* To take full advantage of the demographic dividend, India not only needs an educated but also a healthy population. For this, India has started the National Health Mission (NHM) encompassing its two sub-missions. National Rural Health Mission and National Urban Health Mission, to achieve universal access to equitable, affordable and quality healthcare services.\n\nThough India has initiated all pertinent programmes and policies, to make the dream of demographic dividend a reality the key lies in their effective and efficient implementation.",

      "explanation": "India has been trying to prevent attempts by rich nations to introduce 'new issues' like labour and environment. India wants the discussions on these non-trade and WTO-plus issues to take place only after outstanding matters related to the Doha Round negotiations have been resolved. India took this stand because the declaration brought out at the end of Ministerial Conference of WTO at Nairobi did not reaffirm the mandate of the Doha Round aimed at opening up global trade. India, along with other developing countries, had opposed the declaration.\n\nIndia feels that issues like environment and labour should be kept out of the purview of WTO and instead, should be dealt under concerned global bodies like UNFCCC and ILO. Since rich nations have superior standards on these issues, they can pose a challenge for developing nations by acting as non-tariff barriers, thereby adversely impacting their exports to rich nations. Further, outstanding issues, like the 'Special Safeguard Mechanism' for protecting the interests of poor farmer in developing countries and a permanent solution on public stockholding for food security, need to be resolved before discussing new non-trade issues.\n\nFor this, India wants the countries pitching for introduction of the 'non-issues' to meet the following 2 criteria:\n\n* Establish the relevance of issues in context of trade.\n* Ensure consensus among all 162 WTO members for taking up the agenda.\n\nIndia can only be successful in this endeavour of putting an end to attempts to introduce new issues if it can establish a strong alliance of developing and poor countries and training a sufficient pool of trade law experts to represent them effectively at WTO's Dispute Settlement Body (DSB).",

Skill India programme and Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojna would build a strong force of skilled labour force with certified skills according to standards of National Occupational Standards (NSO).\n\nGender Respective Budget (GRB): GRB would focus on neglected section of the Indian Society in providing education, health care, and skill trainings. Wider implementation of schemes specific to women such as Sukanya Samriddhi Yojana, Janani Suraksha Yojana would empower women.\n\nPrimary education quality should be enhanced because due to lack of elementary education, Skill training programmes cannot be used to their full potential.

Absolution of Zamidari was initiated just after the independence of India by the Union government which streamlined the process of land reforms.\n\nThough the process of land reforms were not as successful as it was intended to because to inactive participation of landlords except some states like West Bengal and Kerala.

      "explanation": "Through persuasion and social influence an audience is intentionally encouraged to adopt an idea, attitude, or course of action by symbolic means utilizing words, images, sounds, etc. This is because the thoughts, behavior and action of people are influenced by other people in their environment.\n\nThe role of persuasion and social influence in the success of the Swachh Bharat Abhiyaan (SBA) is particularly important. The SBA was launched to accelerate the efforts to achieve universal sanitation coverage and to put an end to open defecation. Ending open defecation while on one-hand requires construction of toilets at mega speed, on the other hand it also requires persuading the households to actually use them. Sanitation in India is a behavioural issue which would require a change in mindset of people to adopt safe practices. For this, people need to be educated about the hazards of open defecation.\n\nPersuasive messages via television, radio, Internet or face-to-face communication featuring filmstars, sportspersons and other celebrities exhorting people to change their habits by explaining the damage of poor personal hygiene, littering and open defecation to health of all citizens can go a long way in causing a behaviuoral change.",

      "explanation": "Spirit of tolerance and love in Indian society can be defined as that harmony and assimilation which can be observed among the diverse communities of the country. This spirit can clearly be seen in the ancient world where king Ashoka renounced all violence and war, and took to preaching Dhamma, the special religion of love and peace.\n\nThen we can see that continuously throughout history, India has been home to people as diverse as the Hunas, Parthians, Greeks, Scythians, Turks and later on the Mughals. Though some of them may have come to the country as invaders, they did not or rather could not, see India as an enemy. The result has been a tremendous assimilation or races, languages and cultures - a process that is continuing still. In fact, something similar had already taken place a thousand years earlier when the Aryan-speaking people had migrated into the country, forever shaping the destiny of the country and its post-Harappan people. It was in this spirit of tolerance and love, that perhaps was created some of the world\u2019s most majestic works of art (eg. the Taj Mahal), the most original of interpretations on the meaning and philosophy of life (eg. the Upanishads), and created the most simple and honest forms of devotion to the almighty (eg. Bhakti and Sufism).\n\nThankfully, due to the presence of this spirit in our society so far we have been able to reflect rationally and peacefully to most of the problems that we are currently facing. Then on the global front, India exerts on citizens of this world a great unifying force. This is in the form of non-violence (Ahimsa), peaceful co-existence (NAM); in pledging protection to the global commons (Paris Climate Pact), to the rights of man (democracy, human rights), and to universal nuclear disarmament etc. If one day India has to shine in the comity of nations, if Indians have to truly get involved in the making of a better world, and if someday we have to get rid of tragic things like poverty, pollution, crime and terrorism etc, we will have to share this spirit of love and tolerance and spread it to all human societies across the world.",

      "explanation": "When the Britishers took over, traditional Indian artisans ruled the world and supplied about a quarter of all manufactured goods produced in the world as famously quoted by Peter, the Great that \u2018commerce of India was the commerce of world!\u2019\n\nNationalist economists proposed that with the beginning of British rule in mid-eighteenth century, the process of deindustrialization started for the traditional artisanal industry. The various reasons for that were:\n\n* The traditional artisanal industry lost its many **patrons**, like rulers, zamindars etc. after the coming of colonial rule.\n* The colonial rule flooded Indian market with **cheaper manufactured goods** against which Indian handicrafts lost the competition.\n* The colonial rule also opened Indian markets with **zero import tax** which went in favour of British manufactured goods. Moreover, **Indian goods were severely restricted** in foreign markets due to various regulations and taxes leading to loss of market.\n* The artisans also suffered at the hands of colonial power by having to agree to exploitative terms. The English carried on the put-out system of manufacture where the artisan was supplied with the materials and the finished product was brought at a low price. The English also procured raw cotton from peasants, at a low price and sold it at exorbitant rates to the artisans. Thus, the **artisan suffered both as a buyer and a seller**.\n* With the advent of **railways** in mid-nineteenth century onwards the process of deindustrialization was further fastened by colonial economic and commercial penetration into the hinterlands of India.\n\nThis not only eroded the prosperous income base for millions of Indian artisans but eroded the labour productivity of Indian agriculture due to crowding and the twin pillars of traditional Indian rural economy were completely crumbled.\n\nThus, in a short span of just 200 years (1757-1947) the entire rural economy which was self-sustained and prosperous for ages was completely crippled.",

In return they receive easy access to loans with a small rate of interest to start their micro unit enterprise.\n\n**Role of SHGs in Development Activities**\n\n* SHGs ensure **financial inclusion** of the poor and marginalized by operating as a mechanism for **delivery of micro-finance services** to them.\n* By encouraging and providing opportunities for **self-employment,** SHGs play a critical role in **poverty alleviation**.\n* SHGs build **social capital among the poor, especially women and marginalized sections like SCs and STs**. Most of the beneficiaries of government schemes have been women from weaker and marginalized communities.\n* Participating households **spend more on education** than non-client households.\n* Better income levels due to participation in SHGs have led to improvement on health indicators.\n\n**Measures taken by Government to promote SHGs:**\n\n* As part of the **National Rural Livelihood Mission (NRLM)** or Ajeevika, government facilitates women-led self-help groups (SHGs) by giving them bank loans at easy interest rates. This interest subvention provision has been further extended to more districts.\n* The government has promoted the **Self-Help Group (SHG)-Bank Linkage Programme** to be implemented by commercial banks, regional rural banks and cooperative banks for providing micro-finance to SHGs.\n* **NABARD promotes SHGs** by providing grant support for training, capacity building, skill upgradation, exposure visits etc.\n* Scheme for promotion and financing of Women Self Help Groups (WSHG) is being implemented by NABARD across backward and Left Wing Extremism (LWE) affected districts.\n* A fund called **\u201cWomen SHGs Development Fund\u201d** with a corpus of Rs.500 crore to empower women led SHGs has been set-up. It is to be operated by NABARD.\n* Rashtriya MahilaKosh provides loans to intermediary organizations which further lend it to SHGs.\n\nGiven the important role SHGs play in development activities, the government should continue to act as a facilitator and promoter by providing a supportive environment for SHGs to operate vibrantly.",

      "explanation": "In the last 15 years, India has seen the adoption of an \u2018alphabet soup\u2019 of ambitious national anti-poverty programs. However, the effectiveness of these programs has always been questioned. Below Poverty Line card, traditionally the main point of access to government welfare schemes has turned out to be a failure. According to reports as many as half of India\u2019s poor households do not even possess a BPL card as their allocations have been discretionary.\n\nThe plethora of programmes that have been launched by the various departments, more or less for the same objective, covering by and large the same target group in the same area, has created quite a bit administrative confusion. Another weakness in the implementation side relates to the lack of political will which is quite obvious in the rural development area. The main point of deficient implementation can be summarized as under:\n\n* Half-hearted implementation of the programme\n* Lack of political commitment or strong leadership behind it\n* Faulty administrative structure and also its incapability in translating policy into programmes and plans into action\n* Limited ways of checking corruption and leakages that diverts the flow of benefits.\n\nHowever, not all can be termed a failure. For instance, NREGA, another flagship scheme is universalistic by design, promises employment and a guaranteed income to households. It has been hailed by politicians and experts alike.\n\n**Causes of failure**\n\n* There is no systematic attempt to identify people who are in poverty, determine their needs, address them and enable them to move above the poverty line.\n* There is no commitment by the government to support an individual or a household for getting minimum level of subsistence through any program.\n* The resources allocated to anti-poverty programs are inadequate.\n* There is no method to ensure that programs reach everybody they are meant for.\n\nAs things stand, many of those living in poverty today will continue to remain poor over time. The magnitude of the problem, demands that we address the poverty challenge on a priority basis.",

      "explanation": "Capital formation is the most important factor that drives the economic development of a nation. It is mainly the transfer of savings from households to the business sector that leads to increased output and economic expansion.\n\nIn India, savings have contributed a lot in the economic development since the Indian economy took off in 1960s and 70s. In the past few decades, it has been around 33% of GDP. However, high savings rate is a necessary condition but not a sufficient one for economic development.\n\nMany times high savings in isolation does not lead even to capital formation. One also needs sound banking and financial institutions to mobilize the savings of economy. At the same time, presence of entrepreneurship is also critical to convert savings into productive investment. Some other factors that are essential for growth potential are:\n\n* **Infrastructure:** Sound infrastructure is needed in terms of good supply of power, electricity, roads, railways and robust means of communication.\n* **Ease of doing business:** There should be hassle free environment to start and wind up the businesses in the economy. Bureaucratic hurdles in acquisition of land and licenses should also be minimized.\n* **Human Resource:** Skilled labour force is essential for the improved productive capacity of economy. Capability of human resource depends upon the skills, creativity, abilities and education of the labour force.\n* **Technology:** It increases the productivity and competitiveness of the economy. Today R&D in every domain is essential to be competitive in the international and domestic market.\n* **Government policies:** Policies decide the pace and direction of economy. India has introduced GST recently to unify its own economy and remove the cascading effect of taxes at multiple points. India\u2019s performance of Ease of Doing Business Index has also improved by 30 points (100th position in 2017) due to many policy initiatives.\n* **Social and political factors:** Social factors involve customs, traditions, values and beliefs which contribute to the growth of economy. Political factors such as participation of people in formulation and execution of policies enhance the economic development.\n\nIndia which is on the verge of reaping the benefits of demographic dividend, must launch skill development initiatives to utilize the young labour force. It should also improve ease of doing business and create a conducive environment for investment, better export performance to improve productivity of the economy.",

None of these sectors employ low-skilled workers in large numbers.\n\nThe movement of workers out of agriculture into export oriented manufacturing industry has been especially slow due to requirement of a certain level of skill which is absent amongst most labourers \u2013 resulting in jobless growth. Lack of ease of doing business in India due to labour market rigidities, tax uncertainties, impediments to entrepreneurial growth have further hindered the expansion of a labour-intensive export manufacturing in India.\n\n**Measure to Promote Labour-Intensive Exports**\n\n* **Ease Labour Law regulations** such as wide-ranging and complex laws, mandatory contributions by low-paid workers, and lack of flexibility in part-time work etc. The government\u2019s decision to rationalise around 38 Labour Acts by framing 4 labour codes is a positive step in this regard to encourage exporters to hire more labour.\n* **Promoting Labour-Intensive Sectors** like apparel sector, leather and footwear also have high export potential.\n* **Uninterrupted and Cheap Power Supply** for labour-intensive manufacturers, who operate on low profit margins and for whom high electricity costs can be a make or break issue.\n* **Promoting the Role of SMEs** as labour intensity of SMEs is four times higher than that of large firms by providing adequate state support. MUDRA Bank should be promoted for this.\n* **Skill development** to fill the gap of semi-skilled and skilled workers that manufacturers in India face frequently.\n\nFurther, the **tax** rationalisation **under GST** as well as the **push for Entrepreneurship under Start-Up India and Stand Up India** can also provide a suitable and favourable environment for labour-intensive exporters.",

The world\u2019s largest dairy development programme transformed India from a milk deficient nation to world\u2019s largest milk producer.\n\n**Blue Revolution \u2013** This revolution focussed on management of fisheries sector and has led to phenomenal increase in both fish production and productivity from aquaculture and fisheries resources of the inland and marine fisheries.\n\nOther revolutions which are no less significant includes yellow revolution(oil seed production), golden fibre revolution (jute), golden revolution (horticulture), silver fibre revolution (Cotton) and red revolution (meat production).\n\n**Significance of these revolutions**\n\n* These innovations in agriculture have lifted millions of people out of poverty by generating rural income opportunities for farmers, farm labourers, and also reduced prices for consumers. India has become self sufficient in food grain production with the help of green revolution.\n* The exponential rise in milk production has led to nutritional security among the masses. Per capita availability of milk has reached all time high of 337gms/day.\n* These steps have provided avenues for income diversification for farmers.\n\nTo further carry on the momentum of these programmes and assure food security in long run in face of ever increasing population, there is an urgent need for an \u2018evergreen revolution\u2019 that should focus on all round development of the agriculture sector.",

Easy availability of raw materials, changing lifestyles in urban and rural areas and favourable fiscal policies are giving a push to this sunrise sector.\n\nBut small processing unit in India are suffering from many challenges such as-\n\n* **Infrastructure:** Small processing units cannot invest heavily in infrastructural support such as grading, packaging, cold storage, warehousing, logistics, supply chains etc. They rely on the common facilities in these activities.\n* **Manpower:** Skill shortage is hampering the competitiveness of this sector. There are few institutes which provide adequate training to the labour force in this sector.\n* **Seasonality and perishability:** Most of the agricultural products such as fruits, vegetable, fisheries etc are highly perishable and thus increase the vulnerability of the entrepreneurs to wastage of commodities. The supply of raw materials is also seasonal in nature.\n* **Credit:** Although the industry has been included in the priority sector lending, there are inherent risks involved in small enterprises.\n* **Competition:** Increasing investment in the sector has led to intense competition which has adversely impacted the operating profitability of the units.\n* **Technology:** Value addition is the key factor in the food processing but India still lacks the universalisation of robust technology in this sector.\n\nFood processing industry plays an important role in uplifting the socio-economic status of poor farmers through following ways:\n\n* By providing a vital link between the agriculture and manufacturing sectors, it reduces the wastage of agricultural raw materials and increases shelf life of food products. This helps farmers to sell more in the long run.\n* It links farmers to the agricultural market and provides them better income especially for horticultural\u00a0products.\n* Farmers can also earn more through more exports as value addition increases the competitiveness of products in the international market.\n* It provides employment opportunities in sectors such as packaging, sampling, logistics and other non-farm activities. Thus it helps farmers to shift from farming to non-farming activities and have better lifestyles.\n\nIndia must leverage all the available resources to emerge as a leader in food processing sector.

It dealt with liberalising licensing and measures to encourage foreign investments. However, Industrial growth rate could not match the pace with the overall growth of GDP.\n\n**Constraints to industrial growth**\n\n* **Inadequate infrastructure:** Physical infrastructure in India suffers from substantial deficit in terms of capacities as well as efficiencies. Lack of quality of industrial infrastructure has resulted in high logistics cost and has in turn affected cost competitiveness of Indian goods in global markets.\n* **Restrictive labour laws:** The tenor of labour laws has been overly protective of labour force in the formal sector.\n* **Complicated business environment:** A complex multi-layered tax system, which with its high compliance costs and its cascading effects adversely affects competitiveness of manufacturing in India.\n* **Slow technology adoption:** Inefficient technologies led to low productivity and higher costs adding to the disadvantage of Indian products in international markets.\n* **Inadequate expenditure on R&D and Innovation:** Public investments have been constrained by the demands from other public service demands and private investment is not forthcoming as these involve long gestation periods and uncertain returns.\n\nRecently Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion (DIPP) has proposed various changes in industrial policy that will focus on increasing the industrial growth rate in following manner -\n\n* The new policy aims to attract $100 billion of FDI in a year, up from $60 billion in 2016-17, it will also aim at retaining investments and accessing technology.\n* The policy aims to harness existing strengths in sectors like automobiles and auto-components, electronics, new and renewable energy, banking, software and tourism.\n* The policy also aims to create globally scaled-up and commercially viable sectors such as waste management, medical devices, renewable energy, green technologies, financial services to achieve competitiveness.\n* The policy will also push for reforms to enhance labour market flexibility with an aim for higher job creation in the formal sector and performance linked tax incentives.",

      "explanation": "Inclusive growth is economic growth that creates opportunity for all segments of the population and distributes the dividends of increased prosperity, both in monetary and non-monetary terms, fairly across society. The salient features of inclusive growth are:\n\n**Participation:** People are able to participate fully in economic life and have greater say over their future. People are able to access and participate in markets as workers, consumers and business owners.\n\n**Equity:** More opportunities are available to enable upward mobility for more people. All segments of society, especially poor or socially disadvantaged groups, are able to take advantage of these opportunities.\n\n**Growth:** An economy is increasingly producing enough goods and services to enable broad gains in well-being and greater opportunity. Economic growth and transformation is not only captured by aggregate measures of economic output (such as GDP), but must include and be measured by other outcomes that capture overall well-being.\n\n**Stability:** Individuals, communities, businesses and governments have a sufficient degree of confidence in their future and an increased ability to predict the outcome of their economic decisions.\n\n**Sustainability:** Economic and social wealth is sustained over time, thus maintaining inter-generational well-being. Economic and social wealth comprises of a set of assets that contribute to human well-being, including human produced (manufactured, financial, human, social) and natural capital.\n\nIndia\u2019s economy continues to grow at an impressive rate, with projected annual GDP growth of 7.5% in 2017-18. As GDP per capita has more than doubled in last ten years, extreme poverty has declined substantially.\n\n* Access to education has steadily improved, and life expectancy has risen.\n* Financial inclusion has got a major boost with the expansion of rural banks and schemes like Jan-DhanYojna, incorporation of Information and Communications Technology (ICT) (JAM Trinity).\n* Job, education and food entitlement schemes like MGNREGA, RTE and Right to Food are also helping in deepening the growth further.\n\nHowever India still is home to largest number of poor and malnourished children. Recent reports are suggesting huge income concentration in the hands of few. With looming agrarian distress and jobless growth, inclusive growth is still a distant dream for India.\n\nAccording to WEF report, India has been ranked 60th among 79 developing economies, below neighbouring China and Pakistan, in the inclusive development index.\n\n**Measures for inclusive growth**\n\n* Equity of access to quality basic education including basic financial literacy. Ex: RTE\n* Ensuring quality health and sanitation facilities by making health a fundamental right.\n* Gender parity measures through political representation, women reservation.\n* Measures focused on social security benefits and gender parity, for ex., through gender budgeting.\n* Creating employment opportunities through Make in India, Skill India etc.\n\nThrough these measures inclusive growth can be ensured and the Gandhian dream of reaching to the last man standing in the row can be achieved.",

    "solution": {
      "explanation": "Rice-wheat cropping system is labour, water, capital and energy-intensive, and becomes less profitable as availability of these resources diminishes. The problem is further exacerbated by dynamics of climate change. The relevant factors for decline in yield are discussed below -\n\n* **Decline in Soil fertility:** Due to continuous irrigation and use of excessive flood irrigation, soil in rice-wheat cropping system has become saline. It has resulted into decrease in crop yield.\n* **Climate change:** According to studies, climate change has a negative effect on major crops such as wheat, rice and maize. Increase in annual temperature range has also affected the crop yield of rice and wheat.\n* **Increased input cost:** High rate of infestation with weeds and pests along with contamination of ground water have resulted into high cost of input for cultivation of rice and wheat.\n* **Change in water availability:** Due to excessive use of ground water and consequent depletion of ground water resources, water availability has declined. This has resulted in decline in crop yield.\n\nTherefore, it is imperative to focus on alternate crops. Crop diversification refers to a shift from the regional dominance of one crop to production of a number of crops. Crop diversification helps in:\n\n* **Maintaining soil fertility:** Only those crops are grown in a particular region which are suitable to particular agro climate zone and it helps in maintaining soil fertility because excessive use of nutrients, irrigation is not required.\n* **To arrest depletion of ground water:** It will help in diversifying cropping patterns from water guzzling crops such as paddy to pulses, oilseeds, maize with the aim of tackling the problem of depleting water table.\n* Diversification can also provide habitat for beneficial insects and at the same time reduce colonization by pest.\n\nThe government of India has launched crop diversification scheme in the original green revolution areas of Punjab, Haryana and Western Uttar Pradesh. Under Crop Diversification Programme assistance is provided to states for conducting cluster demonstrations on alternate crops, promotion of water saving technologies, distribution of farm machinery, and awareness through training.",

    "solution": {
      "explanation": "Government subsidizes agricultural inputs in an attempt to keep farm costs low and production high.\n\nThere are various subsidies available to farmers in terms of cheap input credit, seeds and fertilizers, subsidized electricity and irrigation etc. Agriculture subsidies always have some impact on various activities of agriculture.\n\n**Cropping pattern:** Crop selection gets distorted in favour of those crops which have high share of subsidies or attract large volume of subsidies. For example cheap electricity and irrigation subsidies motivated Punjab farmers to go for water guzzling crops like rice.\n\n**Crop diversity:** Crop diversity gives way to the standard staple crops where there is assured market and cost of production is low due to subsidies. For example wheat and rice are the standard crops in present times for Rabi and Kharif season respectively.\n\n**Economy of farmers:** Various subsidies ensure income support to farmers and safe stock of food grains. But at the same time it leads to distorted production patterns, resulting in food inflation.\n\n**Significance of various factors on small and marginal farmers**\n\n**Crop insurance:** It provides income security in case of crop failure due to natural and other reasons.\u00a0 It also gives them cushion against their investment in agricultural activities.\n\n**Minimum Support Price:** Minimum prices ensure a minimum guaranteed income for the crops thereby hedging them from market fluctuations. Guarantee of a buyer while cultivation of crops gives a sense of financial security to the farmer.\n\nThough high MSP for certain produces such as wheat and rice drives farmers to take the \"safe side\" and thus shifts to cereal production rather than fruits, vegetables etc.\n\n**Food processing:** Through value addition it ensures not only better income but long shelf life for the agro products. For the country like India where the wastage is high and over 80% of farmers are small and marginal with limited capacity, their income base can be enhanced through food processing.",

Creation of new states offer possibilities of having better governance structure, greater participation for people, administrative convenience for the State and equitable distribution of resources. Regional development strengthens the equitable and symmetric growth of India.\n\n**Benefits from the Creation of New States:**\n\n* The Economic Survey 2016-17 stated that smaller states in India trade more than the rest. Smaller states offer better and efficient administration which leads to creation of infrastructure strengthening the connectivity in the area, expand its access to market and boost trade for the overall economy of the country.\n* People of the region gain control over its resources and an organic model of growth can emerge to address their economic aspirations.\n* Political stability that arises from better representation of people creates conducive environment for investment in the region. Thereby encouraging regional economic development.\n* The new states can have political freedom to frame legislations that address the unique and specific economic problems of the region affected by its geographical location, sociological conditions, technological advancement, availability of human capital etc. Factors that can hinder the economic growth following the creation of new states:\n* New states may find itself lacking in infrastructure (administrative and industrial), which requires time, money and effort to build. As was observed in the creation of Telangana from Andhra Pradesh.\n* The stabilization of the government and administrative institutions requires time for resolution of various issues such as division of assets, funds and of the state civil services. Also the creation of sustainable linkage from the other parts to the newly formed state\u2019s capital can take time affecting the overall economic stability of the country.\n* Territorial issues, disputes over water sharing (eg Krishna water dispute between Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Maharashtra), disagreements over capital (as observed in the case of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana over Hyderabad) are some other issues that can hinder the economic progress of these States and the country.\n* Mere creation of newer states out of the existing ones cannot guarantee faster and inclusive economic development in the region. The economic benefits from the creation of new states can only be reaped if it is followed by establishment of good governance, sustained socio-political stability and better coordination with the rest of the country.",

The economic and financial feasibility of ICs should be ensured by attracting potential investors to set up manufacturing units at National Investment and Manufacturing Zones (NMIZs). India will also have to rely on foreign players for innovative technologies. The fundamental focus of ICs should be on improving both Industrial and Urban Infrastructure.",

For each district, a central Prabhari offcer of the rank of Additional Secretary/Joint Secretary has been nominated.\n* States have been requested to form a committee under Chief Secretary to implement the programme. States have also nominated nodal offcers and also State level Prabhari offcers.\n* An Empowered Committee under the convenership of CEO, NITI Aayog has been notified to ensure convergence in schemes and address speciffic issues brought out by Prabhari offcers.\n* NITI Aayog in partnering releases delta ranking for the districts. The purpose of this ranking is to spur a sense of competition among dynamic teams in districts.\n\nAs per UNDP\u2019s 2018 Human Development Index wherein India is ranked 130 out of 189 countries, there are significant inter-state and inter-district disparity.

MSP will rescue farmers from low income trap in the following ways:\n\n* **Fixed Remunerations:** The farmers are financially secured against the vagaries of price instability in the market.\n* **Social Security:** The fixed prices for different crops saves farmers from distress selling. This in turn helps them to get out of the clutches of money lenders and middlemen.\n* **Diversification of crops:** The MSP announced by the Government of India for the first time in 1966-67 for wheat has been extended to around 24 crops at the present. This will encourage the farmers to grow these diverse crops to maximize their income.\n\nHowever, a lot is yet to be done as far as MSPs for different crops are concerned.

      "explanation": "India is one of the leading producers of vegetables, fresh fruits and a number of food items. Marketing of fruits and vegetables especially is more challenging than many industrial products because of their perishability, seasonality and bulkiness. A supermarket is a self-service shop offering a wide variety of food and household products.\n\n**The roles of supermarkets in supply chain management are as follows:**\n\n* **Transportation:** The perishability of fruits, vegetables and other food items require swift transportation facility so that their freshness remain intact. Supermarkets are equipped with such swift transportation facilities.\n* **Better Storage Facilities:** The better refrigeration facilities provided by supermarkets increases the shelf-life of these products so that consumers can purchase them fresh.\n* **Price Discovery:** Most of the supermarkets purchase these products directly from the farmers, helping in the better discovery of prices for them.\n\nIn this way, supermarkets help in elimination of intermediaries such as agents and auctioneers. Normally in traditional markets, these agents and auctioneers purchase produce from the farmers and sell it to the wholesalers from where the produce goes to the retailers and then to consumers. The supermarkets eliminate this entire chain, as they procure directly from farmers and sell directly to the consumers.

    "solution": {
      "explanation": "Protectionism refers to government actions and policies that restrict or restrain international trade, often with the intent of protecting local businesses and jobs from foreign competition. E.g.: The U.S.A. has placed tariffs on billions of dollars worth of goods from around the world, recent being 25% tariffs on all steel imports, and 10% on aluminum.\n\nCurrency manipulation refers to actions taken by governments to change the value of their currencies relative to other currencies in order to bring about some desirable objective, such as stimulate exports and retard imports. E.g.: China regularly intervenes to prevent its currency Renminbi (RMB) from appreciating relative to other currencies.\n\nBoth protectionism as well as currency manipulations are considered as trade distortion practices and are counterproductive to global free trade. These not only have impact on global economy but also affect macroeconomic stability of individual economies.\n\nThe effects of these phenomena on the macroeconomic stability of India are:\n\n* **Inflation:** Currency manipulation (here depreciation) results into costlier imports which limits the Consumers\u2019 choice and they end up paying more for the limited quantity of goods and products, thus causing inflation. Similarly, protectionism also limits the choices of consumers. Overall, global competition is a key factor in keeping the price of numerous goods and products down and gives consumers the ability to spend.\n* **GDP:** Protectionism leads to increased import costs as manufacturers and producers have to pay more for equipment, commodities, and intermediate products from foreign markets. This will lead to decrease in real GDP.\n* **Employment:** Protectionism is not only about restricting the flow of goods and services, but also the skilled human resource. Any restrictions on this will not only promote unemployment but will also hamper the growth.\n* **Industrial Growth:** Protectionism may promote inefficiencies by the infant industry as it will have no incentive to make itself efficient through use of technology and long-term investments.\n* **Current Account Deficit:** In the absence of robust export base, the intermediate goods that form part of the global supply chain becomes more expensive because of protectionism, leading to widening CAD. Higher CAD further puts the rupee under pressure and raises the cost of overseas borrowing.\n\nSince, protectionism and currency manipulations do not seem to halt in coming future, it is necessary for India to walk through these murky waters carefully. Indian policy makers need to be innovative and flexible in responding to the current uncertainties of the global world.",

    "solution": {
      "explanation": "National Horticulture Mission (NHM) is an Indian Government scheme promoted with the objective to develop horticulture to the maximum potential available in the states and to augment production of all horticultural products. This scheme was launched under 10th five year plan in 2005-06. Under this scheme centre government contributes 85%, and 15% is contributed by the state government.\n\nThe role of NHM in boosting the production, productivity and income of horticultural farms can be assessed as:\n\n* It provides holistic growth of the horticulture sector through an area based regionally differentiated strategies due to which more than 9 crore metric tons of fruits on 63 lakh hectare land were produced during 2015-16.\n* Horticulture farms are much smaller and horticulture crops have high return on investment which allows marginal farmers to increase their income using small lands.\n* Farmers can plant multiple crops on their land which provide multiple earning resources.\n* Regions experiencing low rainfall and prone to drought are getting benefit from the option of horticulture which requires less water and is less susceptible to crop failure. For example, Bagepalli, a drought prone area in Karnataka-Andhra Pradesh border is now emerging as a horticulture hot spot.\n* Horticulture crops have short turnaround time than food crops which helps in efficient land utilization, increased production and productivity, and also increases income of farmers.\n\nAfter the launch of the NHM, significant progress has been made in area expansion under horticulture crops, resulting in higher production and increase in income. Over the last decade, the area under horticulture grew at an average rate of 2.7% per annum and annual production increases at an average rate of 7.0% per annum. In Bagepalli, for example, the annual turnover was Rs 6 lakh in 2016. But it has been Rs 10 lakh a month in 2018, as farmers swiftly shifted to horticulture crops.\n\nThis form of cultivation is gathering steam across the country, even as the Centre aims to double farmer incomes by 2022. But still challenges like inadequate cold storage infrastructure, limited availability of market, limited support from government and high price fluctuation are needed to be catered to achieve the aim of doubling farmers\u2019 income by 2022.",

      "explanation": "Cropping pattern is the proportion of area under various crops at a point of time. The cropping patterns of a region are mainly influenced by the geo-climatic, socio-economic, historical and political factors.\n\n**In the recent past, a lot of changes have occurred in the cropping pattern in India:**\n\n* There has been a shift towards rice-wheat cropping pattern since the 'Green Revolution' of the 1960s.\n* Paddy, cotton, soybean, and sugarcane cover more than half of total sown area taking over the area traditionally devoted to millets, oilseeds and pulses which were more suited to the local climatic and soil conditions.\n* The gain in the wheat production has come at the cost of millets and sorghum as wheat has been considered superior over them.\n* As India is one of the largest consumer and importer of pulses and oilseeds, the government has tried to increase their acreage and productivity. Higher MSPs has been announced for these crops recently.\n\nCrop patterns in India are changing without consideration for local agro-climatic conditions. This has put a burden on environment, incurring huge long-term losses. Soil fertility has declined while groundwater has receded. Chemical pollution and changing food habits impacting human health are the direct manifestations of this change in crop patterns.\n\n**Millets**\n\n* **Production:** Millets grow well in dry zones as rain-fed crops, under marginal conditions of soil fertility and moisture and are stable yielders. About 30 million acres in India fall under millets. Millets are grown in about 21 States and major impetus is being given on its production in Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Telangana, Uttarakhand, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh and Haryana. Millets are the super foods for the present and future; their short growing season (65 days) makes them commercially sound.\n* **Consumption:** With lifestyle diseases running rampant, millets have returned as a viable option to live healthy life. Various States have been distributing millets such as bajra, jowar and ragi through the PDS.\n\nThere is an unmet demand for rice and wheat which is met by millets. If consumers see millets as a solution to lifestyle disorders, producers have realised that it requires less inputs and is an economically viable option if marketing avenues are created.",

This field has seen a boom in terms of focus on immediate and long-term plans to promote it in India and active involvement of states and central government, private entities, and international players in this regard. The surge in activity is guided by the realization that field of biotechnology holds many promises for India in the following areas:\n\n* **Agriculture:** High yielding varieties of crops, drought resistant plants, etc., have overall contributed to food security of vast population of India; fighting malnutrition by use of biofortified crops, e.g. Dhanashakti-first iron rich pearl millet in India; biofertilizers for ecologically safe enrichment of soil, e.g. algal biofertilizers for rice cultivation.\n* **Industry:** Novel techniques for inexpensive production of several products like corn-syrup, alcohol, eatables like cheese etc., by use of bio-enzymes.\n* **Medicine:** Correction of gene defects via gene therapy to treat diseases like adenosine deaminase (ADA) deficiency; products like genetically engineered insulin hold special significance in India which has a large diabetic population; use of biopharmaceuticals for better medicines with lesser side effects.\n\nThe development in the field of biotechnology has resulted in the development of biopharma industries in the following ways:\n\n* Biopharmaceuticals drugs are structurally same as human compounds. This structural similarity gives biopharmaceuticals the potential to cure diseases rather than merely treat symptoms as done by traditional chemical compound medicines.\n* Biotechnology allows researchers to use cell fusion, DNA-recombinant technologies, and other technologies to modify treatments specifically for individual diseases. Bio-pharma allows clinicians to tailor treatment to the specific medical problems experienced by each patient.\n* The greatest potential for bio-pharma is in gene therapy. Conditions associated with rapidly dividing cells, such as cancer, develop as the result of defective or mutated genes. In gene therapy, scientists replace defective genes with healthy ones to treat existing disease or to prevent disease from developing later.\n\nInitiatives such i3 (Innovate in India); National Biopharma Mission and establishment of Bio-incubation centre\u2019s will provide impetus for the development of this sector. The sector has potential to create new jobs enhance revenues through medical tourism and to develop affordable medicinal market in India as well as abroad.",

    "solution": {
      "explanation": "Agro-based food processing industry, aptly recognised as \u2018sunrise industry\u2019, is described as one that adds value to agricultural raw materials. This value addition converts the raw agricultural products into marketable, easy-to-use or edible products like corn flakes, chips, ready to serve drinks, etc.\n\nThe Indian food processing industry accounts for 32% of the country\u2019s total food market. It is one of the largest industries in India and is ranked fifth in terms of production, consumption, export and expected growth.\n\nHowever, the North-West India showcases a better-developed agro-based food processing industry. The factors for this localisation are as follows:\n\n* **Geography:** The region is blessed with a diverse agro-climatic zones, fertile soil and undulating plains. These support a multitude of crops, vegetables and fruits round the year which provide ample raw material.\n* **Raw material:** Availability of diverse raw materials viz. cereals, fruits, vegetables and livestock provide attractive base for food processing industry in this region. For instance, Punjab accounts for 17% of rice and 11% of wheat production of India. This region also has the distinction of having the largest population of livestock and largest producer of milk in India.\n* **Infrastructure:** Well-connected transportation network, subsidised electricity, irrigation facilities (such as Indira Gandhi canal and Bhakhra Nangal) and ample warehousing and storage facilities contribute to flourishing agro-based industries in the region.\n* **Agricultural marketing:** This region has well-developed agri-export zones, market yards, organised APMCs and mandis, etc. which have provided a conducive environment for the establishment of agro-based industries.\n* **Socio-economic status:** The population of the region has good literacy rate, including financial literacy, and enjoys an efficient banking network. This helps channel easy availability of credit and capital investment.\n* **Policy support:** The Punjab government operates an agricultural mega project policy to facilitate investment in the food processing sector. Additionally, large landholdings, single window clearance, permission to set up private sub e-markets, amendment to APMC Act, etc. have enabled agro-based industries in this region to flourish.\n* **Capacity building and R&D:** Capacity building of the manpower in food processing sector in India is spearheaded by the National Institute of Food Technology Entrepreneurship and Management which is located in Sonepat, Haryana. Likewise, a prominent institution for research and development to improve agricultural productivity and business opportunities is the Indian Institute of Maize Research located in Ludhiana, Punjab.\n\nThe initiatives taken at the Union level like permitting 100% FDI through the automatic route in food processing sector and Scheme for Mega Food Parks under the Ministry of Food Processing Industries are conducive steps. However, the challenges for the industry remain such as fluctuations in the availability of raw material due to climate change, inadequate implementation of the APMC Act, multiplicity of ministries and laws to regulate food value chain, etc.",

      "explanation": "The American Revolution and the French Revolution are considered as a cardinal epoch in world history. It gave a death blow to the old orthodox system of governance and installed modern ideals for governing nations.\n\n### American Revolution\u2019s contribution to Modern World\n\n* **Principles of liberty and democracy:** The declaration of independence proclaimed that \u201call men are equal\u201d. It provided an impetus to the people of the world to demand liberty and freedom.\n* **Constitutionalism:** The revolution led to the first written constitution in the world which served as an inspiration for many nations who borrowed many ideas from the American constitution.\n* The American war of independence gave birth to a novel system of government, viz, Federalism. In the course of time, the federal form of government got popularity. This provided a nice template for powersharing in diverse countries that needed complex polities.\n* **Promotion of Human Rights:** The American war of independence laid stress on the rights of the human being. The \u201cDeclaration of Rights\u201d of Thomas Jefferson awakened the people about their rights.\n\n### French Revolution\u2019s contribution to Modern World\n\n* **The democratisation of society:** The French Revolution was a pan-European revolution. It hacked the roots of the ancient system in Europe and ended the centuries-old feudal system. Before the revolution, the society was based on inequality, disparity, privileges and concessions. The revolution attacked the roots of this disparity. It initiated a new social organization.\n* **Ideals of modernity:** liberty, equality and fraternity brought political awakening in Europe.\n* **Secularism:** The revolution ended the sovereignty, despotism and corruption of the Church. The importance of the worship of intellect and reason became more prominent.\n* The people demanded not only political freedom but also right to property and freedom of expression. They also demanded voting rights. Women claimed equal rights with men.\n* The Revolution aroused the spirit of nationalism. It paved the way for the unification of Italy and Germany. It also popularized the concept of democracy.\n* Colonised peoples reworked the idea of freedom from bondage into their movements to create a sovereign nation-state.\n* Tipu Sultan and Rammohan Roy are two examples of individuals who responded to the ideas coming from revolutionary France.\n\nFrench and American revolution not only laid the edifice for a newly emerging egalitarian society and a new way of polity in their respective countries but they also acted as the philosophical basis and aspiration of the people of other nations. The revolutions highlighted the fundamentals of a civilised world which continues to shape the global aspirations of today\u2019s time.",

      "explanation": "Since the economic reforms, ***Urban Head Count Ratio (HCR) poverty fell from 32% in 1993-94 to 21% in 2009-10***. The fall in poverty in rural India has been even more spectacular, ***where HCR declined from 50% to 34% in the same period***. However, this looks decidedly uncomfortable when confronted with another set of facts on the prevalence of hunger(or under-nutrition) in India.\n\nDespite increase in real income of the people over the last two decades, overall calorie consumption and nutritional intake has not commensurately increased. ***According to Global Hunger Index,***India is second after South Sudan, when it comes to wasting (low weight for height) among children. Also,there are millions of children and adults suffering from ***\u201cHidden Hunger\u201d***.\n\n* The poor are increasingly spending more on education,healthcare,transportation,fuel and lighting. The share of monthly expenditure devoted to these items has increased at such a pace that it has absorbed all the increase in real income over the past decades. This has led to a ***\u2018Food Budget Squeeze\u2019***.\n* Possibly, ***the most important reason for this is shrinking social expenditure by the government which is rendering the urban and the rural poor dependent on market prices of non-food essential items,***like education,healthcare etc which are typically high.\n* Social sector spending has always been low in India compared to other countries. According to the National Health Profile 2018, India spends ***1.02% of the gross domestic product on public healthcare, while Maldives spends 9.4%, Sri Lanka 1.6%, Bhutan 2.5%, and Thailand about 2.9%***.In education, India\u2019s public investment is around ***2.7% of GDP, while it is 3.4% in Sri Lanka and 7.4% in Bhutan***.\n* Another reason is, rural working people are migrating in large numbers to urban centres or other rural areas in search of work. Most of such migration is temporary and seasonal in character, and involves travelling relatively large distances. This large circulation of labor does have substantial impact on the expenditure patterns of households. For instance, an increasingly footloose labourforce means that a large section of the working poor have to bear higher costs of transportation, maintain communication with the sites of work (much of which is seasonal in character), and are deprived of traditional non-market sources of food when away from home.\n* Hunger persists in India also because of a decline in ***access to non-market food sources,*** preference for \u2018***better tasting more expensive calories*** and increased spending on luxury items like radio, TV, and mobile phones, as economist ***Abhijit Banerjee*** writes in his book \u2013 ***\u201cPoor Economics\u201d***.\n* In recent times, talks of Universal Basic Income and replacing food subsidies with Direct Benefit Transfer are gaining ground. These measures may further aggravate the crisis of hunger by exposing the poor to market volatility.\n\nEconomists Amartya Sen and Jean Dreze distinguish two aspects of social security \u2014 ***\u201cprotection\u201d and*\u201cpromotion\u201d**. While the former denotes protection against a fall in living standards through ill health, accidents; the latter focuses on enhanced living conditions- ***\u201ccapability building\u201d***.Government needs to take care of these by increasing expenditure on education ***upto 6% of GDP as recommended by Kasturirangan committee,*** and meet the target of spending ***2.5% of GDP on health helping the poor to focus on nutrition***.",

      "explanation": "Misgovernance has been a major issue that have marred the effective implementation of government schemes and policies. Therefore, the government has been spearheading radical digitisation to induce economic inclusiveness and social transformation, through initiatives like, \u2018Digital India\u2019, \u2018Make in India\u2019 and Skill India.\n\nHowever, implementation of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) based programmes usually faces another set of complex challenges.\n\n### Challenges in implementation of ICT based programmes\n\n* **Low digital literacy:** Illiteracy rate in India is more than 25-30% and digital literacy is almost non-existent among more than 90% of India\u2019s population.\n* **Poor internet connectivity:** Rural India suffers from poor internet penetration due to lack of electricity and poor network quality. This has led to difficulties in Aadhaar Enabled Payment Services (AEPS) and last mile delivery of services.\n* **Problems in Common Service Centres:** Lack of proper infrastructure facilities, unavailability of skilled workforce, huge population to serve, unavailability of last mile connectivity are some common issues faced by CSCs in India.\n* **Errors and Omissions in technology implemented:** Issues related to identity mismatch and denial of services to beneficiaries. For ex: cases where senior citizens have been denied ration via PDS shops due to fingerprints mismatch.\n* **Non-inclusive nature of technology used:** Problems faced by senior citizens, differently-abled, illiterate persons due to complex design of ICT based solutions.\n* **Privacy concerns:** Programme implementation using digital technology requires authorization for collection and usage of public information at large scale. Since, privacy being a fundamental right, there are concerns related to mishandling and misuse of user information.\n* **Data theft and online security:** Cyber security issues like cyber attacks, data theft can cripple sensitive government digital infrastructure like servers, power supply, communication links, etc.\n* **Geographical and weather related problems:** Population residing in difficult terrains like North Eastern hilly region, islands of Andaman and Nicobar and Lakshadweep are difficult to reach. Extreme weather events like cyclones, tsunamis, etc can hamper key communication and mobile internet services.\n\n### Measures for effective implementation\n\n* **Creating suitable infrastructure:** Increasing the number of Common Services Centres and addressing the connectivity issues should be the first priority.\n* **Increasing investment in human capital formation:** Improving digital literacy among the rural youth. Pradhan Mantri Gramin Digital Saksharta Abhiyan (PMGDISHA) that envisages making one individual digitally literate in every rural household is a step in the right direction.\n* **Changes in design and structure of technological solutions:** Government websites should be made user friendly so that they can be used by differently abled and senior citizens.\n* **Mandating digital literacy in school curriculum and co-curricular activities** on the lines of IT Club \u2018e-Kidz\u2019 formed by students of the Government Upper Primary School at Koothattukulam in Kerala.\n* **Involving Private sector organizations:** Corporates can be asked to spend their CSR funds in digital training and providing technological solutions for societal needs.\n* **Role of NGOs and civil society groups:** Akshaya Patra Foundation digitized their kitchen and enabling realtime data collection for serving food to more than 1.76 million children across 12 states in India.\n\nEven though there are several challenges in the effective implementation of such programmes but the benefits of ICT based solutions cannot be neglected. It helped to save revenue for exchequer by plugging leakages, weeding out ghost beneficiaries, targeted delivery of services in real time etc. It has improved transparency, accountability and last mile delivery of basic services to the citizens.\n\nHence, if the challenges and lacunae of ICT based programmes are effectively tackled, e-governance can prove to be an effective tool in bringing social transformation thereby realising the dream of inclusive and prosperous India.",

      "explanation": "India underwent a transition in its developmental planning from macro policy planning to neo-liberal policies in the 1990s. There has also been a gradual shift towards Multi Level Planning in recent times. Multilevel planning integrates decision-makers at all spatial levels in the planning process through negotiations, deliberations, and consultations. This makes policies relevant and need-based. It also sets up process mechanisms/institutions for affecting such cooperation at each required stage.\n\n### Cost-effectiveness operations and better Implementation\n\n* **Tackling Corruption:** Through empowerment and involvement of local bodies, various discrepancies in developmental implementation can be solved. This can help enormously in increasing the effectiveness of poverty alleviation programmes as could be seen through the stellar example of MGNREGA.\n* **Simplification of the implementation process:** This is done by ensuring appropriate role clarity, removing overlapping jurisdictions and establishing necessary linkages across sectoral departments. This will reduce the red-tapism in the administrative setup.\n* **Reducing Planning-Implementation Mismatch:** The planning process will access the capacity of administration and local institutions to implement the objectives of the macro-plan on the ground. Thus it would help in need better outcome and reduce mismatch.\n* **Active people\u2019s participation:** It incorporates a mechanism to intensively engage with people to make more relevant policies. This helps to access the needs and interests of people who are intended to be the beneficiaries of the developmental process.\n* **Deepen democratic traditions:** Multi-Level planning would create a sense of ownership among various administrative units. This would also empower the district level planning committee to contribute to overall policymaking. It deepens the democratic tradition in policymaking and its implementation.\n* **Reducing Regional disparities:** Decentralised planning will help suitability of the implementation strategies and resource allocation for desired outcomes. It would increase the effectiveness of government schemes.\n* **Better supervision and monitoring:** Multi-level planning help in making people and lower administration an active stakeholder in the developmental process. Such planning improves the supervision and monitoring of scarce government resources.\n* **Promote competitive and cooperative federalism:** Strong emphasis is given on participatory development action from the local level upwards.\n\n### Way forward\n\n* **Promoting Evidence-based planning:** It harnesses the knowledge gained from data and information and using it to optimize our planning process and improve results.\n* **Training of Local Government officials in policy making:** This would enable their active participation in the policymaking process and its implementation.\n* **Revamping District Planning Committee:** This is an essential component in the process of decentralised planning as they hold consultation, debate and deliberation and integrates consensus-based choices.\n\nNiti Aayog has taken various initiatives to develop mechanisms to formulate credible plans at the village level and aggregate these progressively at higher levels of government. Similarly, Aspirational District Scheme is also an innovative step in the direction of multi-level planning and implementation. Going further, more such steps should be taken to usher good governance in the country.",

The Act came into effect on 1st July 2017.\n\n**At the Central level, the following taxes have been subsumed in the GST:**\n\n* Central Excise Duty\n* Additional Excise Duty\n* Service Tax\n* Countervailing Duty\n* Special Additional Duty of Customs\n\nAt the **State** level, the following taxes have been subsumed in the GST:\n\n* State Value Added Tax/Sales Tax,\n* Entertainment Tax (other than the tax levied by the local bodies), Central Sales Tax (levied by the Centre and collected by the States)\n* Octroi and Entry tax\n* Purchase Tax\n* Luxury tax\n* Taxes on lottery, betting and gambling\n\n**Revenue implications of GST since July 2017:**\n\n* GST was introduced in July 2017. After the initial transitional issues following the roll-out of GST, revenue collection picked up from an annual average of 89.8 thousand crores in 2017-18 to 98.1 thousand crores in 2018-19.\n* However in 2018-19, indirect taxes have fallen short of budget estimates by about 16 per cent, following a shortfall in GST revenues (including CGST, IGST and compensation cess) as compared to the budget estimates. Indirect taxes have fallen by 0.4 percentage points of GDP primarily due to shortfall in GST collections.\n* According to the Economic Survey, though there has been an improvement in tax to GDP ratio over the last six years, gross tax revenues as a proportion of GDP has declined by 0.3 percentage points in 2018-19 over 2017-18.",

      "explanation": "The Integrated Farming System (IFS) is a combined approach aimed at efficient sustainable resource management for increased productivity in the cropping system. The IFS approach has multiple objectives of sustainability, food security, farmer\u2019s security and poverty reduction by involving livestock, vermicomposting, organic farming etc.\n\nIndian farm sector needs to address the twin challenges of productivity and sustainability along with augmentation of farmer\u2019s income. For this, IFS emerges as one of the most viable options, as it ensures:\n\n* **Productivity:** IFS provides an opportunity to increase economic yield per unit area by virtue of intensification of crop and allied enterprises especially for small and marginal farmers.\n* **Profitability:** It has the capability to make the sector profitable by reducing the use of chemical fertilizer and recycling nutrients.\n* **Sustainability:** In IFS, subsystem of one byproduct works as an input for the other subsystem, making it environmentally sustainable. Moreover, IFS components are known to control the weed and regarded as an important element of integrated pest management and thus minimize the use of weed killers as well as pesticides and thereby protect the environment.\n* **Recycling:** Effective recycling of products, by-products and waste material in IFS is the cornerstone behind the sustainability of farming system under resource poor condition in rural areas.\n* **Income round the year:** Due to interaction of enterprises with crops, eggs, meat and milk, IFS provides flow of money round the year amongst the farming community.\n* **Best utilization of small landholdings:** Indian farmers in many regions such as in north-eastern part, practice subsistence agriculture. They also have a rich traditional base in water harvesting, soil management etc. which could be efficiently utilized under IFS.\n* **Meeting fodder crisis:** Byproduct and waste material of crop are effectively utilized as fodder for livestock (Ruminants) and products like grain, maize are used as feed for monogastric animals (pigs and poultry).\n* **Employment generation:** Combining crop with livestock enterprises would increase the labour requirement significantly and would help in reducing the problems of underemployment and unemployment to a great extent. IFS provides enough scope to employ family labour round the year.\n\nIFS provides multiple benefits that are sustainable and can pave the way for *climate-smart agriculture*. India needs to adopt a \u201cwell designed\u201d Integrated Farming System (IFS) to realise the vision of **doubling farmers\u2019 income by 2022** and **having sustainable agricultural practices**.",

      "explanation": "Watershed project involves conservation, regeneration and judicious use of all the resources like land, water, plants, animals and humans within the watershed area.\n\nThe National Watershed Project also known as Neeranchal National Watershed Project is a World Bank assisted watershed management project. The objective of this project is to support Integrated Watershed Management Program (IWMP) through technical assistance to improve incremental conservation outcomes for the natural resources including water, soil and forests while enhancing agricultural yields in a sustainable manner for farming communities.\n\nWater-stressed regions of India such as Northwest India, Vidarbha region of Maharashtra etc. are prone to drought and water scarcity thus affecting the agricultural production in the regions. **The National Watershed Project has the potential in increasing agricultural production in these regions:**\n\n* The project has led in reduction of surface runoff thus increasing groundwater recharge, soil moisture and better availability of water in water-stressed areas. It also helps farmers to better manage surface and groundwater resources.\n* This has resulted in incremental agriculture productivity and increased cropping intensity through optimum utilization of natural resources like land, water, vegetation etc.\n* For example, a watershed project in Bangaru, Telangana has increased crop yields and cropping intensity significantly. This is also accompanied by a shift towards higher-value crops especially horticultural crops.\n* It will also help to mitigate the adverse effects of drought and prevent further ecological degradation and support farmers in water-stressed areas to adapt to climatic change and ensuring improved livelihoods for people.\n* It helps in the restoration of ecological balance in the degraded and fragile water-stressed areas by increasing vegetative cover and decrease soil erosion through afforestation and crop plantation.\n* People\u2019s involvement including the farmers and tribal is the key to the success of any watershed management program, particularly the soil and water conservation. Successful watershed management has been done at Sukhomajri, Panchkula and Haryana through active participation of the local people.\n\nHowever, watershed project faces certain challenges such as very little community participation, lack of coordination between implementing departments and ministries, etc. Properly educating the people about the project and its benefits or sometimes paying certain incentives to them can help in effective people\u2019s participation. Watershed Development on a large scale is the best solution to overcome water-stressed problems.",

However, the current food grain distribution system is fraught with various defects.\n\n### Issues with the Food Grain Distribution System\n\n* **Inaccurate identification of households:** Presence of inclusion and exclusion errors in identification of beneficiaries.\n* **Leakages in the delivery system:** This takes place during the transportation of food grains to ration shops and from there to the open market.\n* **Financially inefficient:** The centre bears a large financial burden of the food subsidy as the cost of procuring and delivering food grains is about six times its sale price.\n* **Shortfall in the storage capacity:** It leads to the rotting of food grains.\n\n### Reformative steps taken by the Government:\n\n* **Procurement**\n  + **Promotion of nationwide procurement:** Food Corporation of India (FCI) has tried to revamp and restructure the procurement system to cover the entire country. In this regard, FCI has also made special efforts for procurement in the eastern states of India.\n* **Stocking and Storage**\n  + **Use of modern technology in storage:** To prevent rotting of food grains. Irradiation Technology has also been introduced.\n  + **Online Monitoring System:** To bring all operations of FCI Godowns online to check leakages.\n* **Distribution**\n  + **Digitization of ration cards and use of AADHAR:** It has helped to eliminate duplicate and ghost (fake) beneficiaries, and make identification of beneficiaries more accurate.\n  + **Technology-based reforms implemented by states:** End to end computerisation has curbed large-scale diversion of food grains by tracking its delivery from state depots to beneficiaries.\n  + **GPS tracking of delivery:** The tracking of the movement of trucks carrying food grains has helped in monitoring the supply chain. It has been implemented by Chhattisgarh and Tamil Nadu.\n  + **SMS based monitoring by citizens:** Allows monitoring by citizens as they can register their mobile numbers and send/receive SMS alerts during dispatch and arrival.\n  + **Use of web-based citizen\u2019s portal:** For public grievance redressal as they can register complaints or provide suggestions.\n  + **Implementing Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) in Public Distribution System (PDS):** Currently, pilot projects have been started in Delhi and Puducherry.\n\n### Way forward\n\n* **Decentralized Procurement:** Decentralized procurement operations by leading states that have gained sufficient experience in this regard. This would help Food Corporation of India (FCI) to focus on lagging states.\n* **Engagement of the private Sector:** This can help to modernize stocking and warehousing facilities.\n* **Home delivery of food grains:** This can help in increasing last-mile connectivity.\n* **Full implementation of Shanta Kumar** committee **recommendations**.\n\nFood security is crucial for reaping the benefits of demographic dividend and this can be achieved through a robust food distribution system. Competitive federalism should be promoted among states so as to learn from the best practices of other states in managing the food economy.",

      "explanation": "The food processing industry (FPI) is considered a sunrise sector that has gained prominence in recent years. The industry is of enormous significance because of the vital linkages and synergies that it promotes between the two pillars of our economy i.e. industry and agriculture.\n\n**The food processing industry is struggling with the following challenges:**\n\n* **Poor supply chain linkages** that results in high wastage and high costs.\n* **Infrastructure bottlenecks** such as packaging facilities, cold storage, transportation, etc. cause a significant amount of food produced getting wasted.\n* India lacks basic **standardisation and certification infrastructure,** as there is a huge gap in the availability of laboratories, trained manpower, and certification agencies.\n* **Lack of trained human resources** at different levels in the food processing industry mostly due to lack of training infrastructure; lack of specialised training programmes etc.\n* In addition, there are challenges like inadequate demand-based innovations, access to credit, proper branding, etc.\n\nGiven the above-mentioned challenges, the government has taken the following policy initiatives:\n\n* The Ministry of Food Processing Industries (MoFPI) is implementing **PMKSY (Pradhan Mantri Kisan SAMPADA Yojana)** as a comprehensive package for creation of modern infrastructure with efficient supply chain management from farm gate to retail outlet. It is expected to provide a big boost to the growth of food processing sector, help in providing better returns to farmers, create huge employment opportunities especially in the rural areas, reduce wastage of agricultural produce, and enhance the export of the processed food. Under PMKSY the following schemes are to be implemented.\n  + Mega Food Parks\n  + Integrated cold chain, value addition and preservation infrastructure\n  + Creation/expansion of food processing/preservation capacities\n  + Infrastructure for agro-processing clusters\n  + Scheme for creation of backward and forward linkages\n  + Food safety & quality assurance infrastructure\n  + Human resources and institutions\n* **Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) policy:** FDI up to 100%, under the automatic route is allowed in food processing industries.\n* **Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA):** As an apex organisation under the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, APEDA focusses on \u2018export\u2019 of scheduled products.\n* **The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI)** is working to strengthen the food testing infrastructure in India, by upgrading the existing food testing laboratories and setting up new mobile testing labs across the country.\n* The Ministry of Food Processing Industries announced a **scheme for Human Resource Development (HRD)** in the food processing sector. The scheme has the following four components:\n  + Creation of infrastructure facilities for degree/diploma courses in the food processing sector\n  + Entrepreneurship Development Programme (EDP)\n  + Food Processing Training Centres (FPTC)\n  + Training at recognised institutions at State/national level\n\nThe food processing industry is critical to India\u2019s growth and the government should focus on providing adequate impetus to the sector. With the correct set of policy implementations and support, the industry can grow by leaps and bounds, taking India to a new position of strength and prosperity in the global economy.",

      "explanation": "In India, the majority of the population is involved in agriculture but it is not remunerative enough, especially in areas which did not go through the stages of the green revolution. In this scenario, biotechnology holds good potential to transform agriculture. It can affect all steps of the production chain, from agrochemical inputs to final food processing.\n\n* Under **biotechnology,** plants, bacteria, fungi and animals whose genes have been altered by manipulation **(Recombinant DNA Technology)** are called **Genetically Modified Organisms (GMO)**. GMO technology has brought **significant changes in agriculture** and areas related to it.\n* **Tissue Culture** is the science of cultivating animal/ plant tissue in a prepared medium. Technologies based on this can be harnessed to achieve crop improvement objectives.\n* Crops have been made **more tolerant to abiotic stresses** (cold, drought, salt, heat) so the farmers do not have to worry about the weather conditions and can help plants adapt to environmental stress and climate change.\n* It has **reduced reliance on chemical pesticides (pest-resistant crops)** which is pocket-friendly for the farmers and eco-friendly for the consumer by eliminating harmful chemicals from the ecosystem.\n* **Post-harvest losses have been reduced** by increasing crops\u2019 abilities to withstand the transportation period without being perished.\n* **Efficiency of mineral usage by plants has been increased** by it (this prevents early exhaustion of fertility of soil), so a piece of land can be used for a long time for equally good yields.\n* It has **enhanced the nutritional value of food** (like Vitamin A enriched rice) which increases the market value of the product, profiting the farmers and improving human health.\n* Plants developed using biotechnology **naturally resist specific insects, weed plants and diseases** so there is no loss of crop due to these reasons. (Like **Bt crops**).\n* In addition, it has been **used to create tailor-made plants** to supply alternative resources to industries, in the form of starches, fuels and pharmaceuticals etc. which can boost the agricultural-industrial relations uplifting the farmers.\n\nThe benefits of biotechnology are especially meaningful at a time when our global population is growing and our demand for food is increasing, mainly in developing countries. Biotechnology allows farmers to grow more food on less land using environmentally sustainable farming practises which are necessary for them to have a good income and a better living standard. Biotechnology is a powerful tool to feed an increasing world population, but its \u201cpositive and negative potential\u201d should be carefully evaluated.",

The Pala kings were Buddhists and adopted initiative and policies which helped in the enrichment of Buddhism.\n\n* **Religious tolerance:** Most of the subjects of the Palas were Hindus but they followed an approach of religious tolerance. This allowed for a peaceful exchange of ideas between the faiths and was a major factor why Hindu Tantrism made its way into Buddhism, giving rise to the Vajrayana philosophy.\n* **Architecture:** Various mahaviharas, Stupas, chaityas, temples and forts were constructed by the Palas. Built by Dharmapala, Somapuramahavihara at Paharpuris one ofthe largest Buddhist viharasin the Indian subcontinent.\n* **Sculpture:** During this period, most ofthe sculptures ofstones and bronze drew theirinspiration fromBuddhism. The finestsculpturesinclude two standingAvalokiteshwara imagesfromNalanda; Buddha seated inBhumisparsha Mudra and images of Avalokiteshwara seated in Ardhaparyanka. Crowned Buddhas, instead of the earlier bareheaded ascetic figures, also began to appear in Pala times.\n* **Paintings:** The Mahayana cult of Buddhismhad developed its Tantrayana-Vajrayana aspects. The Palaminiatures are in a sense visual expression of these cults. Example: Miniatures on text Astasahasrika-prajnaparamita.\n* **Universities:** During the Pala period, universities became the centre of Buddhist studies. The Palas founded and funded universities like Vikramshila and Odantipur to promote Buddhism, in and outside India. Scholars from all over the world came to these universities to learn the tenets of Buddhism. Many Buddhist teachers from the Pala kingdom travelled to Southeast Asia to spread the faith. For example, Atisha preached in Sumatra.\n* **Foreign policy:** The Palasforged relationships with different culturesto promote new trade routes. The empire enjoyed good connections with Southeast Asia and the Middle East. Devapala even granted five villages at the request of the Shailendra king of Java for the upkeep of the matha established at Nalanda for the scholars of that country.\n\nThe Pala dynasty created the environment to thrive and discuss Buddhist philosophies without prejudice. But, importantly, it also facilitated the spread of these ideas around the world, leaving a legacy that isstill visible today.",

Since almost half of India lies in the tropical region while the other half in the temperate region, therefore all regions within the country are not equally suitable for solar energy generation.\n* South Western parts of Rajasthan, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Karnataka,Odisha, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, and Andhra Pradesh are some of the beststatessuited forsolar power generation, asthey lie in the tropics. On the other hand, areas of Punjab,Himachal Pradesh,Uttar Pradesh, and Bihar are comparatively lesssuited to solar power generation, as they are mainly concentrated in temperate regions.\n* Besides solar radiation intensity, various other factors responsible for installation of solar power plants are quality of local physical terrain, environment, and distance of the site from the nearest substations for grid connectivity.\n* As per current position (May 2020), Karnataka leads the solar power production in the country with a total installed capacity of about 7100 MW. The second position is occupied by Telangana (5000 MW) followed by Rajasthan (4400 MW).\n* India is a solar rich country and is also leading the International Solar Alliance (ISA). In fact, India\u2019s prolific solar power producing states are boosting India\u2019s ability and willingness to ensure fulfilment of the country\u2019s aim of achieving 175 GW of renewable energy by 2022.",

      "explanation": "Poor health constitutes suffering and deprivation of the most fundamental kind. Diseases impact the well being, burden family, weaken societies, and squander potential. Over the years, significant strides have been made in increasing life expectancy and reducing some of the common killers associated with child and maternal mortality.\n\n**Linkages between social development and health care:**\n\n* In developing countries, breaking the vicious circle of poverty and ill-health is an essential condition for development.\n* Health is pertinent for the realization of basic human needs and for a better quality of life. Health is a causative factor that affects a country\u2019s aggregate level of economic growth.\n* The rising out-of-pocket expenditures on healthcare pushes around 32-39 million Indians below the poverty line annually.\n* Women and elderly are one of the most vulnerable sections of society. In this context, access to quality health care and sound health policies are crucial for their healthy development, reducing deprivation, and social empowerment.\n\n**Geriatric Health:**\n\n* Ageing is a continuous, irreversible, universal process, which starts from conception till the death of an individual.\n* However,the age at which one\u2019s productive contribution declines and one tendsto be economically dependent can probably be treated asthe onset of the aged stage of life. National Elderly Policy defines people of 60+ age group as elderly.\n* With well-designed and judicious investments, ageing population can help build-up human, social, economic and environmental capital.\n* However, this would call for investing in all the phases of life, fostering enabling societies, and creating flexible but vibrant environment for building a society for all ages.\n* In order to generate comprehensive data on social, economic and health conditions of the elderly, the Government undertook Longitudinal Aging Study of India.\n* Other initiatives of the Government of India:\n  + Integrated Programme for Older Persons (IPOP)\n  + Rashtriya Vayoshri Yojana (RVY)\n  + Indira Gandhi National Old Age Pension Scheme (IGNOAPS)\n  + Varishtha Pension Bima Yojana (VPBY)\n\n**Maternal Care:**\n\n* Women are strong pillars of any society. Sustainable development in India can only happen through maternal and child care.\n* Maternal health is an important aspect of the development in terms of increasing equity and reducing poverty.\n* The survival and well being of mothers is not only important in their own right but are also central to solving larger economic, social, and developmental challenges.\n* The Sustainable Development Goal 3 pertains to maternal health, where the target is to reduce maternal mortality ratio (MMR) to 70 per 100000 live births.\n* Institutional deliveries are an important means to achieve maternal health. Key initiatives in this are:\n  + Janani Suraksha Yojana\n  + Janani Shishu Suraksha Karyakaram\n* Midwifery initiative aims to create a cadre of skilled nurses for providing compassionate women-centred, reproductive, maternal and newborn healthcare.\n\nHealthcare has a major role to play in reducing social exclusion at the local level, due to its impact on employment, working conditions and household income. It can drive forward the implementation of local and national goals for sustainable development.",

The diverse profile of India diaspora allows it to actively shape the polity and economy of the host country.\n\n**Political Dimensions**\n\n* **Electoral Power:** The growing number of Indians in host countries has entrusted them with the ability to influence election results. Forinstance, Indian-Americans make up around 1% of the electorate, but their votes are crucial in swing states. In 2019, the British House of Commons had 15 MPs of Indian origin.\n* **Emerging Leaders:** Many people of Indian origin hold top political positions reflecting their ability to lead. Examples include Kamala Harris - USA\u2019s vice president,\u00a0 Rishi Sunak - UK\u2019s Finance Minister, Ant\u00f3nio Costa - Portugal\u2019s Prime Minister.\n* **Lobbying Capacity:** The Indian community\u2019s efforts at lobbying the US Congress are seen in the context of diasporic mediations in international relations, like the India-U.S. nuclear deal.\n* **Soft Power:** Indian diaspora through Yoga, movies, spirituality, has created tremendous \u2018soft power\u2019 power in host countries. It helps India to build strong diplomatic relations.\n\n**Economic Front**\n\n* **Technological Prowess:** Indian diaspora is known for their innovative skills and tech-savvy attitude which has contributed in benefiting the host countries. For example, at Silicon Valley, they have significantly contributed towards the growth of the IT industry. Technological giants like Google, Microsoft are headed by Sundar Pichai and Satya Nadela.\n* **Indian Industrialists:** Indian Industrialists have left their mark on American and European industrial landscape. Indians abroad have made the nation a brand. There are several eminent British industrialists of Indian origin, including Lakshmi Mittal, and Hinduja brothers.\n* **MNCs:** Many Indian MNCs have made their global presence felt by investing heavily and creating employment. For example, Jaguar and Land Rover, which are British car manufacturers, are owned by Tata.\n\nThe Indian diaspora has gained new visibility as their political and financial clout has grown. It contributes by way ofremittances, investment, lobbying forIndia, promoting Indian culture abroad and for building a good image of India by their intelligence and industry.",

For example, extraction of mango juice from the pulp.\n\nChallenges Faced by Food Processing Industry In India\n\n* **Supply Side Bottlenecks:** Fragmented land holdings result in low farm productivity. Due to this, farmers are left with a small and dispersed marketable surplus.\n* **Demand Side Bottlenecks:** The demand for processed food is mainly restricted to urban areas of India and the middle and higher class of population.\n* **Infrastructure Bottlenecks:** Lackofmechanizationandpropersupply chainresultsinpooraccesstomarket.High seasonality and perishability requires cold storage & warehousing facilities and road, rail & port connectivity.\n* **Manpower:** There is a shortage ofskilled workers. At each level in the value chain, there are strong deficiencies in technical know-how and support.\n* **Sanitary and Phytosanitary (SPS) Measure:** The stringent SPS measures applied by developed countries also impedes the exports of processed foods.\n\n**Opportunities Associated with Food Processing Industries**\n\n* **Employment Generation:** FPI provides vital linkage between the two pillars of the economy \u2013 agriculture and industry. Therefore, it provides direct and indirect employment opportunities.\n* **Nutritional Security:** Processed foods when fortified with vitamins and minerals can reduce the nutritional gap in the population.\n* **Trade and Foreign exchange:** Food export can be an important source of foreign exchange, given the huge demand for nutritious, easy to eat and time-saving food in the evolving busy liefestyle.\n\n**Food Processing Industry & Farmers\u2019 Income**\n\n* **Value Addition:** Processed foods fetch a better price than the raw items. For example, the value of biscuit is higher than flour although the raw item is the same. Thus, FPI can help farmers in getting a favourable price for their products.\n* **Demand for Agro-Products:** Urbanization is increasing at a rapid pace in India, which subsequently, increases the demand for processed food. The rise in demand for processed food will, in turn, lead to rise in farmers\u2019 income.\n* **Combating Rural Unemployment:** Food processing being a labour-intensive industry will provide localized employment opportunities and thus will reduce the push factor in source regions of migration.\n\nFood processing has become an integral part of the food supply chain in the global economy. India being an agrarian dominated country must leverage its potential in the Food Processing Industry. It will be help India in doubling farmers\u2019 income by 2022-23.",

It basically means a Public-Private Partnership (PPP) which allows joint development and maintenance of government projects.\n\n**Factors that need to be considered while designing a concession agreement**\n\n* The time of concession agreement should be very well defined.\n* It should be clear about the fees, time period and authority.\n* It should be clear about the authority, who will manage, maintain and repair the project in a timely manner.\n* It should be clear about timely financing including viability gap funding.\n* It should be clear about requirements of environmental impact assessment and requirement of land clearance.\n\nConcession agreements are of fundamental importance for the development of infrastructure in the country. It has reduced the time lags and costs involved in undertaking such agreements. Therefore, a well-designed concession agreement will not only help in performance improvement but also help in reducing contract disputes.",

      "explanation": "The Goods and Services Tax is a comprehensive, multi-stage, destination-based tax. It is a single domestic indirect tax law which has subsumed many indirect taxes in India such as services tax, VAT, etc. The Goods and Service Tax (Compensation to States) Act, 2017 provides for a mechanism to compensate the States on account of loss of revenue which may arise due to implementation of the Goods and Services Tax.\n\n**Rationale behind this Act**\n\n* **Raising new revenue sources**: After the introduction of GST, States have very limited taxation rights as most of the taxes, barring those on petroleum, alcohol, and stamp duty, were subsumed under GST. This deficiency is fulfilled by the Union by compensating them.\n* **Fixed revenue growth**: The compensation is calculated based on the difference between the states\u2019 current GST revenue and the protected revenue after estimating an annualized 14% growth rate from the base year of 2015-16. If such a fixed amount is not assured, the Central Government will compensate States for such deficiency.\n* **Guaranteed compensation**: Under the GST (Compensation to States) Act, 2017, states are guaranteed compensation for loss of revenue on account of implementation of GST for a transition period of five years between 2017 and 2022.\n\n**Impact of COVID-19 on GST compensation fund and creation of new federal tensions**\n\n* The gains of GST have started to quickly erode as the slowdown in the economy, exacerbated by the COVID-19 lockdowns, has thrown all revenue calculations to the wind.\n* Due to huge shortfalls in the tax collection under GST the Central government and State Government has come at loggerheads as Centre has shown its incapability to compensate the States as promised under the GST Act 2017.\n* The inability of the Government and binding clause in the Act, caused a conflict between federal ideas under the Constitution.\n* Many states have concern over the compensation in this hour of need and questioned the Centre to break its federal agreement.\n\nIt is time for states to accept the realities and agree to a lower level of compensation, ideally linked to the growth rate of the Indian economy in nominal terms and the Centre must understand that it is their statutory obligation, and they can\u2019t abrogate it. GST reforms must not fall victim to the trust deficit engendered by this standoff between the Centre and the States. Both must cooperate and coordinate in this hour of need.",

      "language": "en",
      "category": "EconomyAndDevelopment"
    },
    "solution": {
      "explanation": "The rice-wheat cropping system has remained a predominant cropping pattern in the Indo-Gangetic region since years. The pattern in itself is so robust that three-fourth of the country\u2019s annual domestic need for wheat and rice is fulfilled by a handful of states in the region. Indian states that predominantly practice this system are Punjab, Haryana, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, and Madhya Pradesh.\n\n**Factors responsible for making rice-wheat system a success**\n\n* The first major reason is the availability of **ideal geographical conditions**. Cultivation of rice requires a good amount of water for irrigation. Fortunately, in India, especially northern India, a good amount of water is available through annual monsoonal rainfall. Similarly, cultivation of wheat requires cool, moist weather, followed by dry, warm weather with optimum temperature range 20-25 degree Celsius. Fortunately, this condition is available in northern India during November to February every year.\n* The second major reason is the **support given by the Government** of India to wheat and rice producers in the form of Minimum Support Price (MSP) procurement. MSP is declared to give guaranteed price and assured market to the farmers and protect them from price fluctuations and market imperfections. Thus, farmers hardly opt for crops other than wheat and paddy.\n* Third major reason is the **low input cost and high productivity** in case of wheat and rice crops. Also, as per the government policy, the increase in MSPs of these two crops every year is comparatively more than the increase in the cost of production. So, farmers producing these crops generally have an increase in their profits year by year.\n\n**The Rice-Wheat system has become bane in India because of following reasons**\n\n* **Residue management**: The straw residue in case of wheat is used in animal husbandry but straw residue in case of rice or paddy cannot be used for animal husbandry due to high silica content. So, to dispose of the residue from the field and make the land ready for the next wheat crop, farmers burn the straw in open fields. This causes major environmental pollution, especially during the months of November-December in the NCR region.\n* **Unchecked water usage**: Paddy has a high-water footprint and therefore leads to large amounts of groundwater extraction for irrigation by farmers. This has declined the underground water table in most parts of northern India. Since artificial recharge of aquifers is still not very feasible in India and groundwater recharge is still dependent on rainfall, the depleting water table is a major issue.\n* **Lack of Crop rotation**: Crop rotation helps to maintain soil structure and nutrient levels and to prevent soil borne pests. Continuous plantation of wheat and rice on the same land has degraded the soil structure and nutrition levels in soil. Cereal crops like sorghum, maize, and millet are more nutritious than wheat and rice and so should be given equal importance in the cropping system.\n* **MSPs**: Since MSPs on wheat and rice ensures good income to farmers at minimal risks, farmers have increased the production of wheat and rice to such levels that there is glut in the market. The burgeoning stocks of wheat and rice means higher social costs and a higher subsidy bill by the government, putting additional pressure on an already stressed government.\n\nThus, to sum up, we can say that the rice-wheat system is doing less good for the country and this is the time to do away with this old agricultural practice. There is an urgent need to take necessary steps to implement new and sustainable agricultural policy and rules in this regard.",

      "explanation": "A disaster is a result of natural or man-made causes that leads to sudden disruption of normal life, causing severe damage to life and property to an extent that the available social and economic protection mechanisms are inadequate to cope. Disaster in India is managed under the Disaster Management Act, 2005.\n\nRecent measures in disaster management are a departure from the erstwhile reactive approach wherein authorities acted after a disaster had ocuured. Such an approach used to focus entirely on rescue, rehabilitation and reconstruction. But recent measures, inter alia, also focus on preparedness, mitigation and adaptation.\n\n**Recent measures initiated in the disaster management:**\n\n* National Disaster Management Services (NDMS) was conceived by NDMA during 2015-16 for setting up of Very Small Aperture Terminal (VSAT) Network connecting MHA, NDMA, NDRF etc. to provide the failsafe communication infrastructure and technical support for Emergency Operation Centre (EOC) operations across the country.\n* NDMA has taken an initiative on Earthquake Disaster Risk Indexing (EDRI) for 50 important cities and 1 district in Seismic Zone IV & V areas.\n* NDMA through the Building Materials & Technology Promotion Council (BMTPC) has prepared Upgraded Earthquake Hazard Maps and Atlases for the country for better planning and policies.\n* The Aapda Mitra scheme of NDMA has provision for training 6000 community volunteers in disaster response in 30 most flood prone districts (200 volunteers per district) in 25 States.\n* The government has set up a National Crisis Management Committee and Crisis Management Group.\n* The state governments have set up state crisis management groups headed by chief secretaries, institutes of relief commissioners and state/district contingency plans.\n* The disaster management policy of the government stresses on forecasting and warning using advanced technologies, contingency agricultural planning to ensure availability of food grains, and preparedness and mitigation through specific programmes.\n* Project on deployment of Mobile Radiation Detection Systems (MRDS) to handle Radiological Hazards in metros/capital cities/big cities in India to detect unclaimed radioactive materials/substances and save the public from its hazardous effects.\n* The Disaster Management Act (DMA) 2005 was invoked by the government to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nNevertheless, in India, disaster management is yet to be seen as integral to development planning. The preparedness at various levels is not people-oriented. India\u2019s capacity to manage disaster risk is challenged by its size and huge population. A scientifically planned adaptation is needed, which will require the government support.",

      "explanation": "The monarchical states subordinated to British India were termed as Princely States. The word \u2018princely\u2019 was deliberately retained during the British regime, to ascribe subordination of the rulers to the British Crown.\n\n**Administrative issues:**\n\n* **Lapse of British Paramountcy**: The Indian Independence Act of 1947 (based on the Mountbatten Plan) provided for the lapse of paramountcy of the British Crown over the Indian states. Many of the rulers saw the departure of the British as the ideal moment to declare autonomy and announce their independent statehood on the world map.\n* **Signing of Instruments of Accession:** The instruments of accession executed by the rulers, provided for the accession of states to the Dominion of India (or Pakistan) on three subjects, namely, defence, external affairs and communications.\n* **Power and Prestige**: The princely states were not comfortable with the idea of giving away their power and prestige. Some of these states that posed problems were Jodhpur, Bhopal and Travancore before independence and Junagarh, Hyderabad and Kashmir post-independence.\n* **Availability of Natural Resources**: Some of the Princely States had good reserves of natural resources, it was believed it could survive on its own and hence wanted to remain independent.\n* **People Resentment**: The Maharaja of Manipur, signed the Instrument of Accession with the Indian government. Under the pressure of public opinion, the Maharaja held elections in Manipur in June 1948 and the state became a constitutional monarchy. The Government of India succeeded in pressurising the Maharaja into signing a Merger Agreement in September 1949, without consulting the popularly elected Legislative Assembly of Manipur.\n* **Connectivity and Agrarian Support**: The Rajput princely state, despite having a Hindu king and a large Hindu population, strangely had a tilt towards Pakistan. Jinnah offered free access to the Karachi port, to arms manufacturing and importing along with military and agrarian support.\n\n**Socio-cultural challenges:**\n\n* **Kashmir:** It was a princely state with a Hindu king ruling over a predominant Muslim population which had remained reluctant to join either of the two dominions.\n* **Hyderabad:** It was the largest and richest of all princely states, covering a large portion of the Deccan plateau. Nizam Mir Usman Ali was presiding over a largely Hindu population in the princely state.\n* **Peasant Protest**: The Telangana Rebellion of 1946\u201351 was a communist-led insurrection of peasants against the princely state of Hyderabad in the region of Telangana that escalated out of agitations. It brought the struggles of the peasantry to the forefront and served as a reminder of the sacrifices made by the people of this region in fighting against the autocratic rule of the Nizam of Hyderabad.\n\nThe rulers of most of the states signed a document called the \u2018Instrument of Accession\u2019 which meant that their state agreed to become a part of the Union of India. Accession of the Princely States of Junagadh, Hyderabad, Kashmir and Manipur proved more difficult than the rest.",

      "explanation": "A gig economy is a free market system in which temporary positions are common and organisations contract with independent workers for short-term engagements. According to a report by Boston Consulting Group, India\u2019s gig workforce comprises 15 million workers employed across industries such as software, shared services and professional services.\n\nGig economy will expand and boost women\u2019s employment because it is based on flexible, temporary, or freelance jobs. This has the potential of absorbing more women and increase their participation in the workforce. This will encourage those women who could not opt for full-time work to join the workforce.\n\n**However, the challenges remain.**\n\n* The gig economy thrives largely unregulated; therefore, workers have little job security and few benefits.\n* A worker needs to be skilled enough. Unless a person is extremely talented, his bargaining power will necessarily be limited. While companies routinely invest in training employees, a gig-economy woman worker will have to upgrade his skills on his own at his own cost.\n* There are already many more potential online independent workers than jobs, and this demand-supply mismatch will only get worse over time, depressing wages especially for women.\n\nTo safeguard the interest of both employers and employees, some labour laws and regulations are required in the changing world of work. Also, documenting best practises across the globe on how different industries are using new technologies and at the same time creating job opportunities for women would help create supportive policies.",

      "explanation": "The Global Gender Gap Report 2021 ranks India at 140 among 156 countries. This gender inequality is the outcome of unequal opportunity, education, health economic participation and empowerment, which results in pushing women into a vicious cycle of poverty and malnutrition.\n\nSelf-Help Groups (SHGs) are informal associations of people who choose to come together to find ways to improve their living conditions. Microfinance is a type of banking service provided to unemployed or low-income individuals or groups who otherwise would have no other access to financial services.\n\nMicrofinancing of women SHGs can help uplift even the most vulnerable and marginalised section of women in the following ways:\n\n* By mobilising poor rural women and building community institutions of the poor, SHGs are aimed at reducing poverty. To this, microfinancing acts as a catalyst because it can help channel the savings and funding of the SGH members.\n* Credit flow will make women work and interact with the outside world. This will help in reducing the gender inequality and promote community involvement.\n* Microfinancing of women SHGs\u00a0improves the decision-making ability of its members. With greater say in the matters of resource utilization, family planning\u00a0etc., it results in better nutritional values among their families.\n\nThough microfinancing of women SHGs can help overcome challenges like malnutrition, poverty and gender equality, it is not alone enough to change the grim situation. Additionally, there needs to be a change of patriarchal mindset, spread of awareness about SHGs and penetration of rural banking facilities.",

Since 2000, at least half of the world\u2019s fastest-growing economies have been in Africa. And by 2030, Africa will be home to 1.7 billion people, whose combined consumer and business spending will total $6.7 trillion. A surplus of workers is something which is turning the heads of everyone towards Africa.\n\n**India\u2019s influence in Africa in recent years:**\n\n* **Political Engagement:** In the last few years, Africa has been the focus of India\u2019s development assistance and also diplomatic outreach, as evident in plans to open 18 new embassies.\n* **Economic Engagement**: India\u2019s duty-free tariff preferential scheme for Least Developed Nation (LDCs) launched in 2008 has benefited 33 African states. India was the fourth largest importing partner and the fifth largest export destination for South Africa in 2017-18.\n* **Grants in Aid:** After South Asia, Africa is the second-largest recipient of Indian overseas assistance with Lines of Credit (LoC) worth billions of dollars.\n* **Capacity Building:** India is investing in capacity building providing more than $1 billion in technical assistance and training to personnel under the Indian Technical and Economic Cooperation (ITEC) program.\n* **Security Cooperation:** Approximately 6,000 Indian soldiers are deployed in UN peace-keeping missions in conflict zones in Africa.\n* **Cooperation on Multiple Fronts:** This includes solar energy development (International Solar Alliance), information technology, cybersecurity, maritime security, disaster relief, counter-terrorism and military training.\n* **Medical Diplomacy:** Under the e-ITEC initiative, India has shared COVID-19 management strategies, training webinars exclusively aimed at training health-care professionals from Africa by Indian health experts.\n\nIndia and Africa offer a lot of opportunities for each other in coming times like addressing the food security problem, becoming the voice of the developing world, preventing global rivalries, and maintaining diplomatic ties. India-Africa (Gandhi-Mandela) friendship in a longer will benefit both mutually.",

The NHRC is an embodiment of India\u2019s concern for the promotion and protection of human rights.\n\n**Functions of NHRC:**\n\n* Complaints and redressal mechanism.\n* Awareness raising, human rights education, training and research.\n* Cooperation with civil society, NGOs and human rights defenders.\n* Coordination with all State Human Rights Commissions.\n* Engagement at international and regional bodies and mechanisms.\n\n**Contributions of NHRC:**\n\n* The Commission took cognizance of many individual cases of displacement on account of mega projects, disasters and conflicts.\n* In the aftermath of Godhra riots in Gujarat, the Commission filed a writ petition in the Supreme Court and ensured that guilty persons were brought to book.\n* With respect to the high suicide rates by debt-ridden farmers, the Commission took *suo motu* cognizance of the reports about suicide by farmers.\n\n**Limitations:**\n\n* NHRC can only make recommendations without the power to enforce decisions. It does not have any mechanism of investigation. In majority cases, it asks the concerned Central and State governments to investigate the cases of the violation of human rights.\n* It has been termed as \u2018India\u2019s teasing illusion\u2019 by Soli Sorabjee (former Attorney-General of India) due to its incapacity to render any practical relief to the aggrieved party.\n* A large number of grievances go unaddressed because NHRC cannot investigate the complaint registered after one year of incident.\n* State Human Rights Commissions cannot call for information from the Central government which means that they are implicitly denied the power to investigate armed forces under the control of the Union government.\n\n**Possible Remedial Measures:**\n\n* NHRC efficacy can be enhanced by government if the decisions of the Commission are made enforceable.\n* There is need to change in composition of the Commission by including members from civil society and activists.\n* NHRC should have its autonomous investigating staff recruited by itself instead of the present practice of deputation.\n* To improve and strengthen the human rights situation in India, state and non-state actors need to work in tandem.\n\nManifold challenges are presented by the situation of persistent human rights violations across the country. There is an urgent requirement to improve and strengthen the human rights situation. It is necessary to empower NHRC to make it work more efficiently and independently.",

      "explanation": "Patriarchy is a social system in which men hold primary power, moral authority, special privilege, and control over property. Despite the prevalence of patriarchy in India, the status of women in post-Independent India has continuously changed with changing socio-economic and political realities. This change has been a result of external agents and catalysts like government initiatives and women-led movements.\n\nWomen have been empowered by spread of education, communication, media, political parties, and general awakening. Women like Kalpana Chawla, Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw and Late Sushma Swaraj represent diverse fields of social work and professional life. But issues like the Sabarimala controversy, Triple Talaq, Madhya Pradesh HC judgement in POCSO Act, etc. highlight that patriarchal barriers to women empowerment remain deeply entrenched in society.\n\nApart from special focus on women education and women empowerment schemes, collective interventions are the need of the hour to change the conception that India is a patriarchal society. This can be done through:\n\n* Imbibing gender equality ideas needs to start within homes, in attitudes of parents, spouse and siblings.\n* Women must have the freedom to take important decisions of life such as which career to pursue, when to marry, etc.\n* Setting up of specially designed courts (Fast Track Courts) for trying cases of violence against women. These courts could be mandated to finalise the case within a stipulated period.\n* The cause of gender equality at work will be helped by balancing maternity leaves with paternity leaves.\n* Administrative reforms need to factor in gender inclusion, especially in police. It can help de-emphasise the culture of violence in public life.\n* Concepts like 24\u00d77 cities can combine urbanisation, needs of public safety, and promote greater participation of women in economy and public life.\n\nThus, education and empowerment schemes are necessary to support the feminist movement, but issues hindering gender equality in India require more fundamental and practical approach.",

A Non-Governmental Organisation (NGO) is a non-profit group organised on community, national and international levels to serve a social or political goal such as humanitarian causes or the environment.\n\n**Role of Civil societies and NGOs as an alternative model of public service delivery:**\n\n* Civil society and NGOs can provide a ready pool of volunteers and resources that the government can tap into.\n* Issues of inclusion-exclusion errors can be addressed through grass-root verification by the volunteers.\n* Skill enhancement and livelihood support schemes like National Rural Livelihood Mission can be made more effective through involvement of civil society and NGOs.\n* The last-mile delivery of public services can be addressed. For example, during the COVID-19 lockdown, several voluntary groups distributed food, ration, and vegetables for the homeless and the migrants.\n* Civil society and NGOs can play the role of effectively communicating the needs of people to the government. For example, the PM Garib Kalyan Rojgar Abhiyan was launched in response to Mazdoor Kisan Shakti Sangathan\u2019s petitioning to distribute food grains to everyone.\n\nCivil societies and NGOs can have a positive influence on the state and the market. But there are various challenges such as:\n\n* Ad-hocism and lack of continuity in the delivery process.\n* The issue of misappropriation of funds is highlighted every now and then. There are issues where the civil society or an NGO is accused of using foreign funds for provoking protests and stall governmental projects.\n* There have also been reports of NGOs lobbying parliamentarians and using the media to manipulate issues in their favour.\n* The \u2018big brother attitude\u2019 of the government officials and their mindset of construing NGOs simply as contractors fulfilling staffing requirements.\n\nCivil society and NGOs can be made an integral part of the development process but, given the prevalent situation, they cannot completely substitute the administrative channels for the delivery of public service delivery. Nevertheless, the civil society/NGOs and the administrative channels need to coordinate to carry out the public service delivery efficiently and effectively.",

      "explanation": "Land reform is a form of agrarian reform involving the changing of laws, regulations, or customs regarding land ownership. Under the British Raj, the farmers did not have the ownership of the lands they cultivated. In post-independent India, many initiatives were taken for bringing land reforms and improving the deplorable conditions of farmers.\n\n**Land reforms helped to improve the socio-economic conditions of marginal and small farmers in the following ways:**\n\n* **Abolition of the zamindari system:** This removed the layer of intermediaries who stood between the cultivators and the state. It kept in check the debt trap and increased the share of marginal and small farmers in the production cost.\n* **Tenancy reforms:** The rent paid by the tenants during the pre-independence period was exorbitant. Tenancy reforms introduced to regulate rent, provide security of tenure and confer ownership to tenants.\n* **Ceilings on landholdings:** It was to deter the concentration of land in the hands of a few. It ensured redistribution of land from big landlords to landless labourers ensuring land ownership, access to credit, and food security.\n* **Consolidation of landholdings:** It prevented the subdivision and fragmentation of land holdings. It brought down the cost of cultivation and reduced litigation among farmers and generated higher incomes.\n* **Cooperative farming:** Under the mechanism, each member farmer remains the owner of his land but farming is done jointly. Profit is distributed among the member farmers in the ratio of land owned.\n\n**Challenges with the land reforms:**\n\n* Land reforms were lengthy and cumbersome process.\n* Benami transactions became a point of concern under land ceiling act.\n* Digitisation of land records with efficiency and correct information will take time.\n\nThe pace of implementation of land reform measures has been slow but the objective of social justice has been achieved to a considerable degree. New and innovative land reform measures should be adopted with new vigour to eradicate rural poverty and improve the socio-economic conditions of marginal and small farmers.",

It provides subsidised food grains to 75% of India\u2019s rural population and 50% of its urban population.\n\n**Salient features:**\n\n* **Eligibility, Coverage and Identification of Households**: The Act defines \u2018eligible households\u2019 under two categories: (i) households covered under the Antyodaya Anna Yojana (AAY) and (ii) households covered as the priority households under the Targeted Public Distribution System (TPDS). The State Government is to identify the eligible households.\n* **Food Entitlements**: Each priority household shall be entitled to 5 kg of foodgrains per person per month from the State Government under the TPDS. The households covered under the AAY shall be entitled to 35 kg of foodgrains per household per month at the subsidised price not exceeding Rs. 3, Rs. 2 and Rs. 1 per kg for rice, wheat and coarse grains respectively for a period of three years from the date of commencement of the Act.\n* **Nutritional Support**: Every pregnant and lactating woman shall be entitled to a meal, free of charge, during pregnancy and six months after the child birth through the local anganwadi and maternity benefit of not less than Rs. 6000.\n* **Food Security Allowance**: The Act stipulates that in case of non-supply of the entitled quantities of foodgrains or meals to the entitled persons, such persons shall be entitled to receive such food security allowance from the concerned State Government.\n* **Grievance Redressal Mechanism**: Every State Government shall put in place an internal grievance redressal mechanism which may include call centres, designation of nodal officers etc.\n\n**Role of food security bill in eliminating hunger and malnutrition in India:**\n\n* As per a UN report, from 2006 to 2019, the number of undernourished people in India has dropped by 60 million.\n* The hunger outcomes amongst the poor and underprivileged have improved through better access to foodgrains.\n* Resilience in the poor against income shocks has increased by broad coverage of the 2/3rd population.\n* According to the UN report, stunting in children under 5 years of age has reduced from 47.8% in 2012 to 34.7% in 2019.\n* Wage loss during pregnancy has been compensated by monetary compensation.\n* The awareness created by the ASHA workers has increased the number of infants who were exclusively breastfed from 11.2 million in 2012 to 13.9 million in 2019.",

      "explanation": "Crop diversification refers to the addition of new crops or cropping systems to agricultural production on a particular farm taking into account the different returns from value-added crops with complementary marketing opportunities. The aim of crop diversification is to increase crop portfolio so that farmers are not dependent on a single crop to generate their income.\n\n**Benefits:**\n\n* At present, 70-80% farmers have land below 2 hectares. To overcome this, existing cropping patterns must be diversified with high value crops such as maize, pulses, etc.\n* Crop diversification can better tolerate the ups and downs in price of various farm products and it may ensure economic stability of farming products.\n* It refers to sudden adverse weather conditions like erratic rainfall, drought, hail, incidence of insect and pest disease. Under this situation, crop diversification through mixed cropping may be useful.\n* Most of the Indian population suffers from malnutrition. Crops like pulses, oilseed, horticulture and vegetables can improve socio-economic status by adding quality to the food basket and also improve soil health with the aim of food safety and nutritional security.\n* Adoption of crop diversification helps in conservation of natural resources like introduction of legume in rice-wheat cropping system which has the ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen to help sustain soil fertility.\n\n**Challenges:**\n\n* Majority of cropped area in the country is completely dependent on rainfall.\n* Sub-optimal and over-use of resources like land and water cause a negative impact on the environment and sustainability of agriculture.\n* Inadequate supply of seeds and plants of improved cultivars.\n* Fragmentation of land holding less favouring modernisation and mechanisation of agriculture.\n* Poor basic infrastructure like rural roads, power, transport, communications, etc.\n* Inadequate post-harvest technologies and inadequate infrastructure for post-harvest handling of perishable horticultural produce.\n* Very weak agro-based industry.\n* Weak research \u2013 extension \u2013 farmer linkages.\n* Inadequately trained human resources together with persistent and large-scale illiteracy among farmers.\n* Host of diseases and pests affecting most crop plants.\n* Poor database for horticultural crops.\n* Decreased investments in the agricultural sector over the years.\n\n**Role of emerging technologies in crop diversification:**\n\n* With the help of IT revolution, farmers are directly connected with grocery-customers (farm to fork model) leading to cultivation of high value perishable products (e.g., Big Basket, BlinkIt startup platforms).\n* Aquaponics and urban farming are a technique of controlled environment cultivation which help in crop diversification in order to meet the heavy urban demand for perishable items.\n* Through financial inclusion and digitisation, small farmers and women self-help groups have been able to ensure crop diversification by credit supply.\n* In arid areas, technologies like Urea Deep Placement (UDP), Poly-bag Nursery farming, etc. have been introduced by Indo-Israel Agriculture Project.\n* Soil health management assisted in facilitating right fertiliser usage, developing organic farming and providing GIS based thematic mapping for soil.",

      "explanation": "Igneous rocks are called primary rocks because they are the first one to be formed in the rock cycle and they do not leave any organic remains. They form when hot, molten rock crystallizes and solidifies.\n\nDepending upon where the molten rock solidifies, they can be divided into two types:\n\n* **Intrusive Igneous Rocks:** They form when magma is trapped deep inside the Earth where it cools very slowly over many thousands or millions of years until it solidifies. Slow cooling means the individual mineral grains have a very long time to grow, so they grow to a relatively large size. These rocks have a coarse-grained texture. Example - Diabase, Granite, Pegmatite and Peridotite.\n* **Extrusive Igneous Rocks:** They are produced when magma exits and cools above (or very near) the Earth's surface. These rocks form at erupting volcanoes, so molten rock erupts on the surface, the magma cools and solidifies almost instantly when it is exposed to the relatively cool temperature of the atmosphere. Quick cooling means that mineral crystals don't have much time to grow, so these rocks have a very fine-grained or even glassy texture. Hot gas bubbles are often trapped in the quenched lava, forming a bubbly, vesicular texture. Example - Basalt, Pumice, Obsidian and Andesite.",

      "explanation": "Deccan Trap is a large region of thick basaltic rock located in west-central India and associated with one of the largest volcanic eruptions in the history of the earth.\n\n* The Deccan Trap covers a significant part of western peninsular India, in states of Maharashtra, Goa, and Gujarat and to some extent in Madhya Pradesh and southern Rajasthan.\n\n**Natural resources found in Deccan Trap:**\n\n* **Soil & Rocks:**\n  + **Black Soil**: It is also known as \u201cRegur Soil\u201d or the \u201cBlack Cotton Soil\u201d.\n    - Black soils are rich in iron, lime, aluminium, magnesium and also contains potassium. However, these soils are deficient in nitrogen, phosphorus and organic matter.\n    - Cotton, pulses, millets, castor, tobacco, sugarcane, citrus fruits, linseed, etc. are mainly cultivated in black soil.\n  + **Rocks:**\n    - Ancient cave temples have been carved out of the Deccan basalts in many places and the Elephanta Caves located on a small island offshore Mumbai (Bombay) is one such place.\n* **Non-Ferrous Minerals:**\n  + **Bauxite:** India\u2019s reserves of bauxite are sufficient to keep the country self-reliant.\n    - Major reserves occur in Jharkhand, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Chhatisgarh, Gujarat, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Goa and Uttar Pradesh.\n* **Ferrous Minerals:**\n  + India is endowed with fairly abundant resources of iron ore. It has the largest reserve of iron ore in Asia.\n    - The districts Maharashtra and Goa have also emerged as important producers of iron ore.\n* **Natural Gas:**\n  + It is obtained along with oil in all the oil fields, but exclusive reserves have been located along the eastern coast as well as Tripura, Rajasthan and offshore wells in Gujarat and Maharashtra.\n    - Recently, the National Geophysical Research Institute (NGRI) has noticed the presence of oil and natural gas in the Deccan region that spreads over a vast area including parts of Telangana, Karnataka, and Maharashtra.\n* **Geothermal Energy:**\n  + The western margin of volcanic Deccan traps, also known as Western Ghats, is characterized by the presence of numerous hot springs.\n* **Nuclear Energy:**\n  + Nuclear energy has emerged as a viable source in recent times. Important minerals used for the generation of nuclear energy are uranium and thorium.\n    - The important nuclear power projects are Tarapur (Maharashtra), Rawatbhata near Kota (Rajasthan), etc.",

The growth of the service sector, which accounts for more than 50% of India's GDP and more than 64% of jobs in tier 2 and tier 3 cities, is a result of globalisation.\n* **Increased wages, the digital revolution, and the westernisation of habits** under globalisation all contributed to the promotion of popular culture and altered this class's consumption patterns.\n* **Government efforts:** The Government efforts through schemes like Make in India, Stand up India, Startup India, MUDRA Yojana, JAM trinity, UDAN, etc. have prompted the culture of consumption by increasing disposable income.\n\n#### **Reasons behind the emergence of Tier 2 Indian cities as major growth engines:**\n\n* **Attractive options for larger firms:** Tier 2 cities like Jaipur, Patna, Indore, and Surat have experienced economic growth rates of more than 40%.\n  + With 80% of households having middle-class incomes by 2030, disposable income is set to increase. In India, consumer behaviour is significantly influenced by value for money.\n* **E-commerce:** Over 15 million traditional \"kirana\" stores, or 88% of the retail market, are present in India. Many families come to stock up on fresh produce every two to three days.\n* **Employment:** The Tier-2 Cities attract potential employees from rural places and provide them with different avenues of employment for them.\n* **Lower Cost of Living:** The moderate cost of living in Tier 2 cities encourages greater consumption since a better lifestyle does.",

      "explanation": "The troposphere is the first and lowest layer of the atmosphere of the Earth. Most of the mass (about 75-80%) of the atmosphere is in the troposphere, and is where most weather phenomena occur.\n\n* Weather refers to short-lived temperature, wind and precipitation conditions that vary from place to place.\n  + **Elements of Weather Processes:** Cloud cover, rain, snow, low or high temperatures, storms and wind.\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Layers of Atmosphere** | **Height ( in km)** |\n| Exosphere | Beyond 400 |\n| Thermosphere | 80- 400 |\n| Mesosphere | 50- 80 |\n| Stratosphere | 10- 50 |\n| Troposphere | 0- 10 |\n\n#### **Significance of Troposphere in Determination of Weather Phenomena:**\n\n* Increasing altitude decreases temperature in the troposphere, thus keeping water from leaving this atmospheric layer.\n  + That\u2019s why the troposphere contains 99% of the total mass of water vapour and aerosols in the atmosphere, and it is therefore the source of most of the clouds that induce weather phenomena.\n* Ozone absorbs sunlight in the stratosphere to raise the air temperature. Thus, temperatures in the stratosphere generally rise with elevation (opposite in case of troposphere)\n  + The Stratosphere acts as a knot that inhibits vertical motion of winds, resulting in weather phenomena that can only be seen in the troposphere.\n* In the troposphere, water evaporates from the surface of the earth and is transported by the wind to other regions.\n  + The rise, expansion, and cooling of air causes water vapour to condense into clouds, producing an unstable atmosphere that causes rain.\n* Global winds and fronts occur in the troposphere creating weather events such as thunderstorms, hurricanes, tornadoes, and blizzards.\n\nTemperatures and weather patterns are shifting due to climate change, causing abnormal weather phenomena in the Troposphere like Heat Waves (recently in Europe and India). Therefore, there is a need to take urgent action to combat climate change and its impact (Sustainable Development Goal 13).",

Later, the 102nd Constitutional Amendment Act of 2018, provided constitutional status to the NCBC.\n\nThere are various transformations that have happened in the new NCBC:\n\n* As a statutory body, it derives its powers from statutes or laws made by parliament while now as a constitutional body it derives its powers and authorities from the Indian constitution.\n* 102nd Constitutional Amendment Act (CAA) inserted Article 338B which is regarding NCBC to examine complaints and welfare measures. This was lacking in the previous NCBC.\n* 102nd CAA also inserted a new Article 342A, which brings greater transparency as the Act specified the concurrence of parliament which is mandatory in the amendment of the list of backward classes.\n* In the new NCBC, the focus has shifted from reservation to the development of the backward class and the inclusion of grievance redressal.\n\nHowever, there are some underlying issues like, the recommendation of the NCBC is not mandatory and it has no responsibility to define backwardness.\n\nThus, NCBC is an important commission for social progress. It should be gender sensitive and there should be no vote bank politics for better implementation of its rules.",

Introduction of PPP will help in providing better infrastructure services through improved operational efficiency.\n* The funding available and capacity of public sector to implement project on time remains limited, partnership with the private sector is an attractive alternative to increase and improve the supply of infrastructure services.\n* PPPs are beneficial in supplementing limited public sector capacities to meet the growing demand for infrastructure development.\n* It will develop local private sector through joint ventures with large firms in areas such as: civil works, electrical works, facilities management, security services, cleaning services, maintenance services.\n* The long-term value-for-money is extracted through appropriate risk transfer to the private sector over the life of the project \u2013 from construction to operations.\n\n#### **Role of PPP model in the redevelopment of Railway Stations in India**\n\n* The station redevelopment comprises two components:  \n  + **Mandatory station redevelopment:** It will make smooth and hassle-free travel.\n  + **Station Estate (Commercial) development:** It will enable to tap several revenue streams to ensure the viability of entire project.\n* The Government of India pushing for reforms in railway infrastructure with the help of PPP. The first station redeveloped through PPP process is Gandhinagar in Gujarat.\n* Other stations will be redeveloped such as New Delhi, Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus and many more including in tier 2 and tier 3 cities.\n* The responsibility of train operations and safety certification rests with Indian Railways.\n\nPPPs offer the public sector potential cost, quality, and scale advantages in achieving infrastructure service targets. NITI Aayog strategy for new India @ 75 envisages many targets in railway infrastructure like increasing the speed of infrastructure from the present 7 km/day to 19 km/day, 100% electrification of broad-gauge track by 2022-23.",

With the availability of capital, more MSMEs, start-ups, etc., can be established that can play a crucial role in economic growth.\n* Pension-related schemes (Atal Pension Yojana, etc.) also constitute a key part of financial inclusion. This allows the elderly population of the country to remain economically productive and allow them to lead a dignified life.\n* Technology-driven financial inclusion (UPI) can also lead to economic growth since it helps in plugging leakages and enable larger people to integrate themselves with the formal financial services in the country.\n\nThe market economy despite being economically efficient is not the ideal system for the implementation of inclusive growth which is based on equity and socio-economic welfare.",

Working from home has allowed people to dedicate more time to their respective economic engagements and vocations resulting in higher labour activity and resultantly productivity.\n\nFurther, sectors such as ed-tech and other digitally driven fields have flourished during the same period and have contributed to higher labour activity and subsequently productivity and eventually to higher economic growth.\n\nAlso, the initiative taken by the government in launching several important schemes (Skill India) aimed at the upskilling of the workforce and encouragement to the start-up ecosystem (Startup India) has resulted in the creation of a skilled and well-equipped workforce.\n\nAlso, the reinstatement of economic activities after nearly two years of Covid-induced lockdowns has led to increased labour activity and productivity.\n\nSeveral initiatives can be taken to create a growth pattern that ensures the creation of jobs without compromising labour productivity.\n\n* Manufacturing-intensive industries, the MSME sector and start-ups should be promoted to ensure the creation of an adequate number of jobs to ensure without compromising labour productivity.\n* Government, through capital expenditure can create jobs and ensure that labour productivity is not compromised.\n* Further, it can also initiate programmes aimed at upskilling the workforce as well as increasing government recruitments in a financially prudent manner.\n* A focus on automation and the introduction of new and efficient technologies is another method of maintaining labour productivity and ensuring economic growth.\n* Efforts should be made to bring those sections of the population into the mainstream workforce that have hitherto not been able to make an active contribution to labour activity.\n\nThus, increased labour activity and the resultant increase in productivity and economic growth have been important features of the post-pandemic economy. An economic growth pattern that ensures its continuation is thus very important.",

    "solution": {
      "explanation": "Agriculture is the backbone of the Indian economy. Even, with the growth of other sectors, agriculture still continues to play a dominant part in the overall economic scenario of India. Agricultural marketing is mainly a state entitlement with the Central Government providing support under central sector schemes. The upstream process of agricultural marketing includes inputs to agriculture like seeds, machinery, and technology and the downstream process includes the food processing industry.\n\nHowever, there are still many challenges in upstream and downstream process of agricultural marketing:\n\n* In the upstream process, lack of coverage of reform policies is one of the main hindrances in addressing the issues of agricultural marketing. For example, only some States have adopted the Agricultural Produce and Livestock Marketing (APLMA) Act fully.\n* Contract farming has been taken out of the Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) domain, citing conflict of interest and this creates lacunae in the upstream as well as downstream process.\n* Another downstream bottleneck is flawed MSP provision which forces the private traders to buy produce at or above MSP or penalizing for not doing so, which can kill the private markets for agricultural produce.\n* There should be effective provision of procurement by the State and its agencies with the involvement of local institutions like Primary Agricultural Credit Societies (PACS) and producer companies as it effects sourcing activities and purchasing activities in upstream and downstream process.\n* Most disappointingly, Agricultural Produce and Livestock Marketing (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2017 (APLMA, 2017) ignores the vexed issue of the role of Arthiyas (commission agents or CAs) in the APMCs and maintains them as central agents in the system. This effects the whole agricultural marketing process.\n\nHowever, with some reforms like the removal of entry barriers, involvement of other stakeholders and electronic settlement of sales, the process of marketing of agricultural products can be improved.\n\nAddressing the challenges of the agricultural market is complex, yet doable, as the doubling of farmers\u2019 income cannot come without developing a thriving market of agriculture. Hence, it is high time that focus must shift from agricultural production to agricultural marketing.",

      "explanation": "Integrated Farming System (IFS) is an interdependent, interrelated often interlocking production system. The IFS model combines various compatible enterprises such as crops (field crops, horticultural crops), agroforestry (agri-silvi culture, agri-horticulture), livestock (dairy, poultry, small ruminants), fishery, mushroom and bee culture in an synergistic way so that the waste of one process become the input for other processes for optimum farm productivity.\n\n**How is it helpful to Small and Marginal farmers:**\n\n![](TEST_IMAGES/UPSC_MAIN_CSE_GS_2022_PAPER_3_Q14_IMG_1.png)\n\n* **Utilising the by-products** of one component of the farming system as an input in another to ensure supplementary and complementary enterprise relationship. Thus, effective input cost is reduced. For example, cattle dung mixed with crop residues and farm waste can be converted into nutrient-rich vermicompost.\n* **Maximization of yield of all** component enterprises to provide steady and stable income at higher levels.\n* **Rejuvenation/amelioration** of systems productivity and achieve agro-ecological equilibrium.\n* Control the **built-up of insects-pest**, diseases and weeds population through natural cropping system management and keep them at low level of intensity.\n* **Reducing the use of chemical fertilizer** and other harmful agrochemicals and pesticides to provide pollution-free, healthy produce and environment to the society at large.\n* It will help in **mitigating the negative impact of agriculture** or livestock on the environment.\n* Regular **stable income** through products like egg, milk, mushroom, vegetables and silkworm cocoons etc..\n\nAccording to the Agriculture Census 2015, India has 86% small and marginal farmers, hence ensuring their livelihood is critical to ensuring inclusive growth. Small and marginal farmers should always be encouraged to implement IFS. It will also help the government achieve its aim of **doubling farmers' income** and increasing agriculture's total **GVA** to the economy at large. However, there are some limitations with the IFS:\n\n* Financial restrictions prevent small and marginal farmers from affording huge cattle or setting up ponds for fisheries.\n* Lack of awareness among farmers and hesitancy to adopt newer farming systems and technologies.\n* MSP is provided only for 23 crops. It does not apply to other crops such as Mushrooms and Beekeeping industries.\n\nIFS fulfills multiple objectives, including making farmers self-sufficient by ensuring the family members get a balanced diet, enhancing the standard of living by maximizing the total net returns and providing more jobs, overall upliftment of rural community and conserving the natural resources and crop diversity.",

      "explanation": "Digitalization is the process of moving to an internet-based infrastructure of doing things which generally increases economic and managerial efficiency in a business.\n\nIndian economy has ample scope and potential of digitalization as around 77% of the population has active cellular connection and 1/3 of the population uses social media. With penetration rate of 48.7% India has around 700 million internet users.\n\n**Problems in digitalization**\n\n* **Cost:** While digitalization reduces operational costs for the business, setting up infrastructure is a high-cost occurrence.\n* **Infrastructure:** The unavailability of internet and its regular services in areas with less infrastructural development is a problem.\n* **Privacy:** A grave concern with digitalization is the vulnerability to security breaches and subsequent compromising of data.\n* **Digital Literacy:** Digital literacy in India is also low especially in rural areas. Women have even lower digital literacy.\n\n**Possible improvements**\n\n* **Comprehensive Policy:** Policies that address the current issues of privacy, security, digital literacy and work towards building infrastructure are needed.\n* **Investments:** Digital infrastructure and digital literacy need to be worked on and thus significant investing needs to be done.\n\nWhile the digitalization in India has grown sharply in the past few years, with digital economy\u2019s contribution to Gross Value Added (GVA) increasing from 5.4% in 2014 to 8.5% in 2019 much work still needs to be done.",

By limiting land ownership, land ceiling policies aim to reduce the concentration of land in the hands of a few wealthy landowners.\n\n**Land ceiling as an effective reform**\n\n* Increased equitable land distribution contributes to a wider base of population that can contribute immensely to economic growth of the country.\n* With a wider population experiencing economic growth, people are bound to get better health, and prefer better education for their offspring. This elevates standard of living.\n* Wider tax base is provided with increased number of farmers earning from their lands, which leads to better tax collection.\n\nLand reforms in India have not just helped in providing resources to the landless, but also in addressing historical injustices and imagining a more inclusive future.",

      "explanation": "The \u2018care economy\u2019 and \u2018monetized economy\u2019 deal with nature and value of the work and are two different aspects of economic activities.\n\nCare economy refers to the unpaid or underpaid work related to caregiving and providing social support, often performed within households. For example, childcare, eldercare, domestic work etc. Inter alia, it also involves paid labour encompassing nurses, caregivers, etc. (often females). The compensation is generally absent or very meagre compensation is awarded for such activities. It is highly undervalued even though it supports human development and social cohesion.\n\nMonetized economy includes all economic activities that are dealt with in terms of monetary value, which includes production of goods, e.g., finance, trade, etc. It is mainly aimed at profit generation. The compensation is received in terms of monetary value. Work done and goods produced in the economy are compensated in terms of wages, salaries, etc. It is assessed by its contribution to GDP and is often used as a measure of economic growth.\n\n**Ways to integrate care economy into monetized economy through women empowerment**\n\n* Social protection measures are required that provide income security for women in caregiving roles. For example, pension insurance for women engaged in such roles.\n* Development of skills for better transformation and incorporation of women into formal sector should be emphasized.\n* Supportive government policies should be there to promote gender-neutral reforms and collaboration between government and civil society organizations in care giving economy.\n  + For example, National Creche Scheme for the Children of Working Mothers, enhancing of maternity benefits, etc.\n* Technological solutions for care sector that reduces time and frees up women for formal sector employment can be considered.\n\nIntegration of care economy into monetized economy will not only enhance economic opportunities for women but also contribute to a more inclusive and equitable society.",

British colonies acted as a resource pool (of cotton, indigo, etc.) as well as a market for these goods.\n\n**Industrial Revolution and a Declining Handicrafts and Cottage Industry**\n\n* **Hand v/s Machine Made Goods:** A subsidized flow of mass-produced machine-made goods was bound to throw handcrafted and expensive, Indian goods out of the market.\n* **Discriminatory Policies:** The British imposed a policy of laissez-faire, levying high tariffs on Indian goods exported to England while allowing cheap British goods to enter India with minimal tariffs.\n* **Unemployment and Shift to Agriculture**: The destruction of local markets weakened the livelihoods of artisans, causing many to lose patronage from rulers and wealthy patrons.\n  + An unemployed workforce was forced to abandon their craft and turn to agriculture or other menial jobs to survive.\n* **Exploitative Farming:** Population with sizable amount of land was forced to carry out cash crop cultivation of specific crops which were needed for the British industries. e.g., The Indigo Plantation.\n* **Eventual Decline in Innovation:** The influx of cheaper machine-made goods reduced demand for handcrafted items, leading to lower production and quality, as artisans couldn't afford to innovate.\n\n**Indian Perspectives**\n\n* **Drain of Wealth:** Dadabhai Naoroji's theory highlighted how British exploitation drained India's wealth, hindering industrial growth and development.\n* **Swadeshi Movement:** Mahatma Gandhi emphasized that British industrialization came at the cost of Indian livelihoods, and urged Indians to boycott foreign goods.\n* **Jawaharlal Nehru:** In his book \u2018The Discovery of India\u2019 argued that British policies deindustrialized India, turning it from a manufacturing hub into a supplier of raw materials.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe structural damage to the Indian society caused by the Industrial Revolution still lingers on. However, framers of our constitution understood the power of cottage industry for a country like India and hence Article 43 clearly prompts the country to establish them.",

As per the Central Ground Water Board groundwater levels are declining at an alarming rate of 0.5 to 1 meter per year in this area.\n\n### Body\n\n**Reasons for Declining Groundwater**\n\n* **Rapid Urbanization:** A rise in demand leads to over-extraction of groundwater. Unregulated drilling of borewells is a major cause.\n* **Over-Irrigation:** A problem of abundance, this leads to detereorating soil health as well.\n* **Inadequate Rainwater Harvesting:** Despite abundant monsoons, rainwater is lost instead of replenishing the groundwater.\n* **Climate Change and Erratic Rainfall:** Irregular rainfall patterns, prolonged droughts, and increased evaporation due to rising temperatures hinder groundwater recharge.\n\n**Food Security Amid Crisis**\n\n* **Reduced Crop Yields:** With less groundwater available, farmers will face water shortages for irrigation, especially during dry seasons.\n  + This can lead to lower crop yields for water-intensive crops like rice and wheat, which are staples in India.\n* **Increased Dependence on Rainfall:** As groundwater levels drop, farmers will rely more on unpredictable monsoons.\n  + Making agriculture more vulnerable to droughts and erratic rainfall patterns, resulting in unstable food production.\n* **Higher Costs of Production:** Farmers may need to dig deeper wells or invest in more expensive water extraction methods, raising the cost of cultivation.\n  + This will in turn make food more expensive and less accessible, impacting affordability.\n* **Loss of Livelihoods:** Declining groundwater could force small and marginal farmers to abandon agriculture, reducing agricultural output and threatening rural livelihoods, further affecting food security.\n\n**Addressing Groundwater Decline**\n\n* Promote Efficient Irrigation techniques like **drip and sprinkler irrigation.**\n* Implement **rainwater harvesting** systems in urban and rural areas to recharge groundwater levels.\n* Shift from **water-intensive crops** like rice and sugarcane.\n* Encouraging water efficient and technologically advanced **methods of construction.**\n* **Policy interventions** such as providing **financial incentives** for farmers to adopt water-efficient technologies and practices is required.\n* Proper implementation of river rejuvenation programmes such as Namami Gange, with addition of artificial recharge structures can help recharge groundwater.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe decreasing groundwater potential in the Gangetic Valley threatens India's food security. Immediate actions are essential for sustainable groundwater management and adapting agricultural practices to secure the country's long-term food supply.",

      "explanation": "### Approach:\n\n* Introduce answer writing briefly about buffer stocks with relevant facts.\n* Explain what buffer stocks are and their role in price stabilization.\n* Highlight key benefits, including food security and support for farmers.\n* Identify major issues like storage inadequacies and procurement imbalances.\n* Suggest improvements in infrastructure and distribution efficiency.\n* Conclude positively with emphasizing the potential for enhanced food security and market stability.\n\n### Introduction\n\nBuffer stock is a reserve of commodities aimed at offsetting price fluctuations and emergencies. Introduced during the 4th Five Year Plan, it stabilizes agricultural prices, ensures food security, and protects farmers incomes.\n\n### Body\n\n**The importance of buffer stocks for stabilizing agricultural prices in India**\n\n![](TEST_IMAGES/UPSC_MAIN_CSE_GS_2024_PAPER_3_Q14_IMG_1.png)\n\n* **Food Security:** Ensures food grain availability for vulnerable populations during adverse conditions like droughts or floods.\n* **Public Distribution**: To ensure monthly release of food grains through the Public Distribution System (PDS) and Other Welfare Schemes (OWS).\n* **Emergency Response:** To address unexpected situations arising from crop failures, natural disasters, etc.\n* **Price Stabilization:** Helps maintain stable prices of essential grains by regulating supply. For instance, in 2022-23, the FCI released 34.82 lakh tonnes of wheat, reducing retail inflation in cereals.\n* **Support to Farmers:** Guarantees a minimum support price (MSP) for produce, stabilizing farmer incomes and encouraging agricultural production.\n* **Disaster Management:** Provides immediate food relief during natural disasters, exemplified by the supply of free rations during Covid-19.\n\n**Challenges:**\n\n* **Storage Issues:** Inadequate storage facilities cause significant wastage and spoilage, with around 74 million tonnes (22% of foodgrain output) wasted annually in India.\n* **Procurement Imbalance:** Excessive procurement of rice and wheat leads to overstocking, neglect of other grains, and hampers crop diversification.\n* **Financial Burden:** Large buffer stocks incur high costs in procurement, storage, and distribution, with transit losses causing FCI to lose approximately Rs. 300 crores annually.\n* **Distribution Inefficiencies:** The Public Distribution System (PDS) faces issues like leakages, pilferage, and corruption, with leakages at 22% as per the 2022-23 NSS survey.\n* **Quality Concerns:** Maintaining the quality of food grains over long periods is a major challenge.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBuffer stocks are vital for stabilizing prices and ensuring food security in India. Addressing storage and procurement issues, along with improving infrastructure and distribution, will make the system more effective and benefit both farmers and consumers.",
