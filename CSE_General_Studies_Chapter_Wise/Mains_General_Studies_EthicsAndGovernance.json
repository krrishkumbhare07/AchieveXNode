      "explanation": "A watershed is a geo-hydrological unit, which drains into a common point. Watershed management is a comprehensive programme to maximize land and water utilization available in the region. Micro-watershed development projects involve regional planning at village and other micro levels to manage and improve water use efficiency that indirectly enhances agricultural productivity and income of rural households.\n\nMicro-watershed management through development projects become imperative in drought-prone and semi-arid regions that reels under constant water scarcity and drought conditions. Ways in which such development projects help conserve water are:\n\n* **Land Development** that includes in-situ soil and moisture conservation measures like contour and graded bunds that are fortified by plantation.\n* **Afforestation Programmes** that include block plantations, agro-forestry and horticultural development. This increases the green cover of the region and enhancing ground water recharge rate.\n* Repair, restoration and up-gradation of existing common property assets and structures under the watershed projects optimize sustained benefits.\n* Innovative management practices like crop demonstrations for popularizing new crops/varieties that are less water dependent and are well suited to the agro-climatic conditions of the region.\n* Other measures like renovation and augmentation of water resources, desiltation of tanks for drinking water/irrigation also improves water availability in the region.\n* Development of small water harvesting structures such as low-cost farm ponds, check-dams under watershed management programmes also augments percolation & ground water recharge rates.",

    "solution": {
      "explanation": "Article 370 of the Indian constitution is a temporary provision which grants special autonomous status to Jammu and Kashmir. All the provisions of the constitution do not apply to it. Besides Article 1, other provisions of the constitution can be applied to the state with exceptions and modifications as specified by the president in consultation with the state government. The power of the Parliament to make laws for the state is limited to four subjects \u2013 external affairs, defence, communication and ancillary matters. On other matters listed in the Union and Government list, Parliament can make laws only with the consent of the state of J&K.\n\nHowever, the Article 370 itself clearly states that provisions with respect to the state of J&K are only temporary and not permanent. The president can declare that article 370 ceases to be operative or operates with exceptions and modifications. But this can be done by the President only on recommendation of constituent Assembly of the state. Thus, Article 370 cannot be revoked unilaterally by the centre and since the last Constituent Assembly was dissolved in 1957, a new Constituent Assembly of J&K would have to be convened.\n\nFor this, the state legislature of J&K would have to agree and since the ruling party at centre is a part of the coalition at the state level also, perhaps now is the right time to broach the issue which is usually a victim of the trust deficit between the centre and state.",

      "explanation": "India as a republic has an elected head of the state with political sovereignty vesting with the people and public offices open to every citizen without discrimination. The preamble states that India is a sovereign, socialist, secular and democratic republic.\n\n* **Sovereign:** This implies that India is an independent state and has the freedom to conduct its own affairs. Whether it be opting for a Non-alignment in its foreign affairs during the cold war or even domestically, India has the power to legislate on any subject without influence of any other state or external power.\n* Though recently, global considerations have played an important factor in decision making due to India\u2019s membership of WTO, IMF and WB.\n* **Socialist:** India envisages to be a socialist state to end poverty, disease and inequality by pursuing democratic socialism i.e. co-existence of both public and private sectors.\n* Though there has been a roll back of the state with the opening of the economy, post-1991 economic reforms, the role of state has changed but has not entirely eroded as a regulator and facilitator in ensuring welfare of public.\n* **Secular:** This means that in India all religions are protected and supported equally by the state and the state does not uphold any religion as state religion. The Supreme Court of India has held it to be a part of the basic structure of the constitution and defended it on multiple occasions in its judgements.\n* Even in current times of intolerance, the faith, worship, ritual and secular activities of religious groups are protected under Fundamental Rights.\n* **Democratic:** The Preamble envisages India to be democratic not only politically but also socially and economically. India is a representative parliamentary democracy where people can exercise their sovereignty through legislature. The democratic character of India is evident through the periodic elections based on universal adult franchise, rule of law, independence of judiciary etc.\n\nIncreasing role of money and muscle power in elections, has resulted in parliamentary inefficiency, but the democratic character of India has only weakened, not destroyed.",

Further, nothing in Ninth schedule can abrogate fundamental rights as they form basic features of the constitution.\n* The objective behind Article 31B of the Constitution is to remove difficulties and not to wipe out judicial review per se. Therefore every amendment to the constitution including amendment to the Ninth schedule has to be in accordance to the basic structure doctrine.\n\n**The judicial review is of key importance among the basic structure of the constitution as**\n\n* Judicial review is an effective means to protect the fundamental rights of citizens from legislative oversight.\n* It is used to protect the primacy of constitution against the breach of power by legislature and executive.\n* Judicial review attains primary importance as it subjects all legislations to close scrutiny adhering to the doctrine of basic structure which includes judicial review itself.\n* Without judicial review, basic structure would be rendered powerless and open to violation by arbitrary or draconian laws.\n* Judicial review is an effective tool for safeguarding the Constitution which becomes extremely necessary keeping in mind the bad experiences of Emergency.\n\nTherefore, judicial review is a crucial aspect and cornerstone to our constitutional setup. However necessary care should be taken to ensure that judicial review doesn\u2019t lead to judicial overreach which is harmful for a democratic set up like India.",

    "solution": {
      "explanation": "An authority is described as quasi-judicial when it has some attributes of judicial provisions but not all. It has powers analogous to that of the law imposing bodies but it is not a court. Quasi-judicial bodies have powers of imposing laws on administrative agencies, instead of supervising over all types of disputes like courts. Their activity is restricted to the issues that concern the particular administrative agency. Their powers are usually limited to a particular area of expertise, such as financial markets (SEBI), human rights (NHRC), market practices (Competition Commission of India) etc. Their action may be appealed to a court of law. They act as an alternative justice system to lessen the burden of the courts.\n\nTaking the example of the Central Information Commission - its powers and functions, as defined under the Right to Information Act of 2005 sufficiently indicate that it has adjudicatory powers quite akin to the court system. The Commission may be called upon to decide how far the right to information is affected where information sought for, is denied or whether the information asked for is \u2018exempted\u2019 or impinges upon the \u2018right to privacy\u2019 or where it falls in the \u2018no go area\u2019 of applicability of the Act.\n\nHence, the functions of these authorities are more aligned towards the judicial functions of the courts rather than mere administrative acts of the State authority.",

      "explanation": "The McBride Commission Report was one of the most significant multilateral interventions in the history of international communication. The main aim of the report was to analyse communication problems in modern societies, particularly relating to mass media and news, consider the emergence of new technologies, and to suggest a kind of communication order to diminish these problems to further peace and human development. The report argued that Western cultural and financial dominance over the poorer nations through the media denied those countries growth and development. The committee was setup to suggest a kind of New World Information and Communication Order (NWICO). It discussed issues like media coverage of the developing world, unbalanced flows of media influence, concentration of media, commercialization of the media and unequal access of information and communication.\n\nThe main political force behind NWICO was the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) representing the developing countries of the \"South\" or the \"Third World\". India particularly played a very significant role by facilitating various meetings in different generics, cultural and geographical backgrounds. This was supported by India\u2019s diverse language culture and the need to preserve and share one\u2019s language beyond the realms of culture was what made MacBride really unique back then. B.G. Varghese was the Indian who represented the nation in the committee which drafted the MacBride report.",

      "explanation": "Financial inclusion means providing financial services such as basic bank accounts , deposit and saving facility at very low cost to poor section of society or to those who are not having access to banking sector so that they can also enjoy basic banking facilities and they can be integrated with formal banking system.\n\nIn this direction Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojna(PMJDY) was started with a wide vision to provide access to banking facilities to those people who are not having any bank accounts or still unbanked from formal banking sector. The necessity of PMJDY in financial inclusion is because of following reasons:\n\n* According to census report of 2011 out of total population only 58.7 percent population have access to banking services remaining 42%. PMJDY would bring in those who have been left behind by mainstreaming banking services and would reduce the role of money lenders.\n* Under this scheme people would get basic bank accounts with **insurance facility and an additional facility of overdraft**. Thus they would avail benefit offered by banks and facilities provided by government and will be able **to develop small savings habits, and which will enhance capital formation,** resulting in **increased economic development of country**.\n* Banks are now opening bank accounts **with zero balance** and providing facilities to poor and unbanked section of society so that they can also get maximum benefits from banking sector.\n* **Debit card facility** is also very helpful to poor people where they can withdraw money at any time and at any place.\n* Under PMJDY bank accounts can be opened **with a single document** (Easy KYC Norms), this will encourage uneducated customers who hesitate to go to banks just because of lengthy documentation process.\n\nThe PMJDY is playing its role in great manner by ensuring mass participation of people and providing them low cost financial services and banking facilities, still there is need to impart financial knowledge and awareness among people about benefits of banks and basic banking facilities. But just opening accounts would not fulfil the desired goals of financial inclusion because of idle banks accounts which only increase expenses of banks. Real benefits would go to people when people will use these accounts. Demonetisation helps in a great way in this direction.",

FDI in an economy helps in relaxing the domestic savings constraints. It helps to overcome the foreign exchange barrier thereby increases capital flow and provides risk-sharing capital financing. It furnishes the funds needed for the full utilization of the existing production capacity.\n\nIt promotes efficiency and productivity through international competition of superior quality products. It provides access to the superior technology, superior managerial skills and bigger markets.\n\nA remarkable inflow of FDI in various industrial units in India will boost the economic life of our country. It can also ensure a number of employment opportunities by aiding the setting up of industrial units in various corners of India.\n\nAccording to the World Bank\u2019s Ease of doing Business Index, Indian Economy is less attractive because of infrastructural bottlenecks such as availability of electricity, dealing with construction permits; registering property; getting credit; protecting minority investors; paying taxes; trading across borders corruption, strict labour laws etc. Other than these reasons, difficult of exit policy, red tapism, bureaucratic inertia, political deadlock play great role in maintaining gap between MoUs signed and actual FDIs in Indian economy.\n\nLand acquisition for industry is contentious in India, particularly when the purchaser is foreign. Concerns about the control of natural resources by foreign companies have stymied efforts to liberalize foreign investment\n\nThe world's fourth-largest steelmaker by output POSCO signed a preliminary agreement to build the $5.3 billion facility, with capacity to produce 6 million tons a year. Posco dropped the project because of deteriorating market conditions and delays in securing mining rights.\n\nInsolvency and Bankruptcy Code, Ease of doing business, establishment of Special Economic Zone, Labour laws reforms can help in attracting FDIs in Indian economy.",

      "explanation": "Impartiality and non-partisanship imply acting solely according to the merits of the case and serving equally well the governments of different political persuasions. An impartial and politically neutral civil service is a defence against the spoils system which has the propensity to degenerate into a system of patronage, nepotism and corruption. An impartial civil service is more likely to assess the long-term social payoffs of any policy whereas the politically motivated may have a tendency to look for short term political gain. It takes decision on merit and is free from any partisan consideration. Further, a non-partisan civil service is also responsible to the Constitution of the land to which they have taken an oath of loyalty.\n\nHowever, political neutrality is no longer regarded as the accepted norm with many civil servants getting identified with particular party dispensation. Officers cultivate and seek patronage from politicians for obtaining suitable positions post-retirement. Further, civil services is being seen as increasingly politicized with wholesale transfer of civil servants seen with changes in governments particularly at state level. Therefore, political neutrality and impartiality of civil services needs to be preserved for a heterogeneous society like India to function smoothly. Example: Das Commission\u2019s Report 1964 on illegal acts by highly placed officials to curry favour with political heads in Punjab.",

      "explanation": "Ethics in general can be described as those beliefs or standards that incline one to act or choose in one way rather than another.\n\nActs and choices that one bases on ethical values serve social and human well being. Human well-being talks about different aspects of one\u2019s lives such as happiness, health, freedom, autonomy etc. Ethical choices promote social and human well-being by being impartial, i.e., no one person\u2019s well-being is regarded as more worthy than any other\u2019s. This can be in the case of business - not keeping profit as the sole objective, technology-making use of innovations and advancements that are constructive and non-threatening to humanity etc. Instead of being hedonist and materialistic, we care about the consequences of our actions on the lives of others. By living a virtuous life, not only does a person live a morally satisfactory life but also ensures that other people are not adversely impacted by his/her actions. Therefore, ethics have an instrumental role in the social and human well-being by contributing to social harmony.",

      "explanation": "Seven Social Sins is a list that Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi published in his weekly newspaper Young India in 1925.\n\n**Politics without Principles:** Gandhi said when politicians (or anyone else, for that matter) give up the pursuit of Truth they, or in the case of parties, would be doomed. Partisan politics, lobbying, bribing, and other forms of malpractice that are so rampant in politics today is also unprincipled. Politics has earned the reputation of being dirty. It is so because we made it dirty. We create power groups to lobby for our cause and are willing to do anything to achieve our goal.\n\n**Wealth Without Work:** Gandhiji's idea originates from the ancient Indian practice of Tenant Farmers (Zamindari). The poor were made to slog on the farms while the rich raked in the profits. With capitalism and materialism spreading so rampantly around the world the grey area between an honest day's hard work and sitting back and profiting from other people's labour is growing wider.\n\n**Pleasure Without Conscience:** This is connected to wealth without work. People find imaginative and dangerous ways of bringing excitement to their otherwise dull lives. Their search for pleasure and excitement often ends up costing society very heavily. Taking drugs and playing dangerous games cause avoidable health problems that cost the world hundreds of billions of dollars in direct and indirect health care facilities. Gandhi believed pleasure must come from within the soul and excitement from serving the needy, from caring for the family, the children, and relatives. Building sound human relationships can be an exciting and adventurous activity.\n\n**Knowledge Without Character:** Our obsession with materialism tends to make us more concerned about acquiring knowledge so that we can get a better job and make more money. A lucrative career is preferred to an illustrious character. Our educational centers emphasize career-building and not characterbuilding. Gandhi believed if one is not able to understand one's self, how can one understand the philosophy of life. An education that ignores character- building is an incomplete education.\n\n**Commerce Without Morality:** As in wealth without work we indulge in commerce without morality to make more money by any means possible. Price gouging, palming off inferior products, cheating and making false claims are a few of the obvious ways in which we indulge in commerce without morality.\n\n**Science Without Humanity:** This is science used to discover increasingly more gruesome weapons of destruction that threaten to eventually wipe out humanity. The NRA says guns don't kill people, people kill people.\n\n**Worship Without Sacrifice:** True religion is based on spirituality, love, compassion, understanding, and appreciation of each other whatever our beliefs may be \u2014 Christians, Jews, Hindus, Muslims, Buddhists, Atheists, Agnostics etc. Gandhi believed whatever labels we put on our faith, ultimately all of us worship Truth because Truth is God.",

Competence and loyalty\n2. Care and diligence\n3. Responsibility\n4. Integrity\n5. Honesty\n6. Objectivity and impartiality\n7. Without discrimination\n8. In accordance with the law\n\nA \u2018Public Service Authority\u2019 is also envisaged to oversee the implementation of the code, violation of the code would invite punishments and penalties.\n\nThis code assumes significance since there is no Code of Ethics prescribed for civil servants in India at present, although such codes exist in other countries. The code aims to prevent misuse of official position or information. At the same time, it provides for public servants to serve as instruments of good governance and use public moneys with utmost care.",

      "explanation": "John Rawls in his theory of social justice attempts to solve the problem of distributive justice. Rawls derives two principles of Justice: the liberty principle and the difference principle.\n\nIn his concept of the liberty principle, Rawls explains that each person is to have an equal right to the most extensive basic liberty compatible with a similar liberty for others. In his concept of the difference principle, social and economic inequalities are to be arranged so that:\n\n1. They are to be of the greatest benefit to the least advantaged members of society, consistent with the just saving principle.\n2. Offices and positions must be open to everyone under conditions to fair equality of opportunity.\n\nA important aspect of Rawls\u2019s theory of justice is that decisions on the distribution of resources should be from the perspective of \u201cnot knowing\u201d what your own position in life is.If you decide to deprive others because you do not have a particular need, you are not operating in a just way for all of society. If your choices are all about you and your needs, first this is unjust to everyone, and second, you may find yourself at the mercy of others someday.",

      "explanation": "Corruption is not an exclusive feature of modern times alone. In his Arthashastra, Kautilya provided a graphic illustration of corruption by saying that, \u2018just as it is impossible not to taste the honey (or the poison) that finds itself at the tip of the tongue, so it is impossible for a government servant not to eat up, atleast, a bit of the king\u2019s revenue\u2019.\n\nFor Kautilya, corruption and administration were integrally linked. He provides a comprehensive list of 40 kinds of embezzlements. Arthashastra states that an increase in expenditure and lower revenue collection was an indication of embezzlement of funds by corrupt officials. He defined self enjoyment by government functionaries as making use of or causing others to enjoy what belongs to the king. This is similar to the current practice of misusing government offices for selfish motives such as unduly benefitting the self, family members, friends and relatives either in monetary or non-monetary form which harms the larger public good.\n\nTo check this, he prescribed a strict vigil over the superintendents of government. He suggested professionalism at work to curb the decline in output and corruption. He advocated hefty fines to be imposed apart from the confiscation of ill-earned hordes. Kautilya also proposed that several positions in each department should be made temporary. He favoured the periodic transfer of government servants from one place to another. This was done with the intention of not giving them enough time to pick holes in the system and manipulate it to their advantage. Even today, his thoughts hold merit if corruption as a menace is to be removed from governance.",

However, such frustration is a by-product of the achievement of other objectives that the public also values highly such as desire to ensure fairness, justice and equality in treatment of citizens \u2013 a crucial qualitative feature of modern government that is largely taken for granted. For example, sometimes the detailed information that offends or irritates the individual from whom it is requested is exactly the requirement of efficient and effective administration. This implies that an office-ridden, form ridden, regulation ridden existence is largely in evitable as long as one wants a modern and democratic government.\n\nHowever, this idea that bureaucracy might be a substantive ethical domain in its own right has been criticised as being inherently unethical. This one sided rationality sustains itself through repressing and marginalising of values. This results in the bureaucracy developing into an elite class at the cost of other sections of the society.",

Discharge of toxic waste is not only morally wrong but is environmental hazardous too.\n\n**(b)** Course of action that can be advised to her is as follows:\n\n* Moral persuasion should be the first step. She should consult her colleagues one more time. It is likely that would still not budge but again there is a possibility that she might be able to conscience even one of them.\n* The residents of the villages must be made aware about their right to life which includes a healthy life.\n* After some ground work like talking to villagers, the health problem faced by them, testing the level of toxicity of rivers a report must be made. She can show this report to her immediate senior to remind the company of the environment laws as well as corporate social responsibility.\n* Since profit is the sole aim of the company she can present a case study where companies lost business due to loss of confidence of people.\n* She can take the assistance of the local NGO as well as media to create pressure on the company as well other big industries working on similar lines.\n* She can inform the district administration of the same wrongdoing and seek their help.\n* As a last resort she can file public interest litigation on behalf of the villagers as the toxic level of discharge and take head of the whistle blower\u2019s act.\n\nThere is high chance of her loosing the job, so simultaneously she can start looking for a new job since even if the complains go unheard she might not continue in the company on moral grounds.",

      "explanation": "**(a)** Ways to satisfy company\u2019s goals to address resident\u2019s concern:\n\n* Environment impact assessment should be conducted in the first place with a non partisan approach.\n* Government and Company must work in tandem to ensure that the problems of the residents are taken care of through the CSR programs. However, CSR programs alone will not be able to do much, so correct initiatives must be taken by the government too.\n* Legislative Representative of the area should accompany the company officials when information camps about the project are set up to develop a sense of belief amongst the residents. If the residents are convinced that the intentions are as genuine as the talks they will not be bothered with the project.\n\n**Issues involved in this case**\n\n* Due to limited livelihood options increased cost of living for the people most of which might belong to lower middle class strata or below will become a major problem to handle.\n* Since the area is already underdeveloped resources like land, water, public services like health, education, a planned sewer management system will be inadequate. An under planned area with sudden migration of people will not be able to cater to the basic needs like health, resident or education for the people which is known to have long term effects.\n* Though the company claims to tackle all the difficulties through CSR, construction of basic infrastructure can take a lot of time which may further add to the chaos.\n\n**(b)** Blockade always arises due to lack of faith and doubt on the intentions of the company which is always, seen as profit making. To negate this company should adhere to its promises which in turn will be benevolent for both the parties. Such cases bring in the question of right of life versus development of community. For example lands were acquired by the Andhra government for developing the capital city of Amravati and they were promised that 20% of their land will be returned after being developed. Such initiative instill confidence in people and they would eventually not oppose such development.",

      "explanation": "Gupta coins are among the most remarkably detailed coins from ancient India featuring exquisite artistic details. They stand out from coins crafted during the reign of other dynasties on following\u00a0counts:\n\n* Achievement of remarkable craftsmanship was evident by the finesse of the variety of images carved on both faces of the coin and its smooth and even wedges.\n* Detailed carvings ranged from Chandragupta riding a horse to Samudragupta playing a Veena and the Goddess Lakshmi to a sacrificial horse for Ashvamedha ceremony and so on.\n* Apart from these detailed images, there were inscriptions as well, often adding details of the image inscribed on the coin.\n* Also, most of the important kings of Gupta dynasty are now believed to have had multiple coin-types during the course of their reign, in which older designs were dropped and newer motifs were adopted.\n* Scholars have pointed out that such designs were made possible by use of clay-molds by skilled mint-masters.\n\nIn the post-Gupta period, not only the quality of gold coins fell, but also the numbers of gold coins being issued dropped drastically. Due to systemic economic distresses, town-based artisans producing good quality coins were forced to migrate to the countryside causing a decline of craft production and a decay of townships. Without urban centres and foreign trade, and with increasing decentralisation of political power which had resulted from the urban to rural migration of artisans, the excellence of Gupta numismatic art could not be sustained or recreated in the times that followed.",

It is an ideology on which communal politics is based and consists of three elements:\n\n* A belief that people of same religion have common secular interests i.e. they have same political, economic and social interests. So, they can be segregated as a distinct socio-political community.\n* It indicates that in a multi-religious society like India, the common secular interests of one religion are dissimilar and divergent from the interests of another religion.\n* The interests of the follower of the different religion or of different \u2018communities\u2019 are seen to be completely incompatible, antagonist and hostile.\n\nIn independent India the Ayodhya issue where construction of a temple or masjid has been constantly evoked to reap political mileage in a country where deep religious sentiments of different communities are attached. Year after year and election after election this issue has been evoked to polarize the communities on religious line for electoral gain at the cost of delicate social fabric of a multi-religious and multicultural India.",

      "explanation": "Cities like Bangalore, Hyderabad, Chennai, Pune, Mumbai, Delhi-NCR etc grew significantly and fastidiously in the last two decades owing to growth in the IT-related services sector. The employment provided by the IT sector agrees with middle-class values and aspirations, further boosting the relevance and importance of these IT hubs, and further causing inward migration to these destinations.\n\nSince, these IT hubs employ a considerable number of people, and since they attract a host of other related and unrelated services needed to cater to the daily needs of these employees, it causes the twin problems of over-population and over-crowding. The result is that municipal services get over-stretched, housing prices soar, traffic gets congested, prices of essential commodities inflate, and most importantly social tensions develop and increase. Sometimes, civil and police administrative machineries are also put to test in these cities. Especially in bigger cities like Delhi-NCR where IT hubs create sub-localities within the city, policing power is seen decreasing proportionately to the size and scale of a locality\u2019s policing requirements. This is why problems like crimes against women, child abduction, racial-religious mob violence etc happen with great frequency in such places.\n\nLastly, the growth of cities as IT hubs creates problems with pollution, waste disposal and energy management. Also, E-waste generation and its associated harms, and also the strain that IT infrastructure put on the electric grid, are much bigger challenges than one would like to admit and the only way forward is to follow sustainable development practices while developing IT hubs.",

There is clear evidence that level of hunger declined in most of the states.\n* \u201cGaribiHatao\u201d (Removal of Poverty) gained prominence during 1970s with emphasis on welfare of the masses.\n* Food for Work Programmes implemented from time to time aimed towards providing food in lieu of work also met with some success. It was felt that it would address the dual need of the employment and food.\n* The accessibility issue of food was assured by Targeted Public Distribution System (TPDS) introduced in 1997. Better targeting ensured reduction in levels of poverty and hunger.\n* More recently, employment generation programmes like MGNREGA and DeendayalAntyodaya Yojana have met with unprecedented success in improving livelihood of the people.\n\nBut the challenges still remain.\u00a0 According to the latest Global Hunger Index (2017), India got a lowly 100th position out of 119 countries.

As the primary arm of government, the civil services **must reform to keep pace with the changing times** in order to meet the aspirations of the people.\n\nThere is a need for reforming the civil services as they have fallen short on the goals of neutrality and effectiveness due to the following reasons:\n\n* Career-based civil services coupled with excessive job security have led to a sense of complacency and lack of accountability amongst civil servants.\n* Goal displacement due to emphasis on rules rather than results \u2013 with rules becoming an end in themselves.\n* The current system of training for the civil services does not adequately reflect changes in the socio-economic scenario and the emerging new challenges render conventional approaches and practices of administration obsolete and dysfunctional.\n* Ivory-tower approach of civil servants due to disconnect from ground realities is reflected in their ineffective policy making. There is a marked lack of citizen-centric approach which is essential to understand and redress problems of the poor and the weaker sections.\n* Lack of stability of tenure due to government\u2019s inherent right to transfer a civil servant prevents the incumbent to learn on the job, develop his/her own capacity and then contribute in the best possible manner.\n* Political interference in the form of arbitrary and whimsical transfers to ensure administrative acquiescence prevents the civil servant from acting neutrally.\n* Promise of post-retirement appointments to statutory commissions, quasi-judicial tribunals, constitutional authorities or contesting election for a political office on the ticket of a political party prevent the civil servant from acting impartially.\n* Promotions hinge on several factors such as patronage versus merit.\n\nTherefore, the purpose of \u2018reform\u2019 is to reorient the civil services into a dynamic, efficient and accountable apparatus for public service delivery built on the ethos and values of impartiality, neutrality and effectiveness. Holistic reforms are needed, cutting across dimensions of training (domain competence), promotion (performance related), tenure (stable), and interface with citizens (sensitivity training) etc.",

      "explanation": "For an administrator, a conflict of interest situation arises when there is actual or apparent conflict between public duty and private interest of a public official. In such a situation official's private interest could improperly influence the performance of official duties.\n\nIn recent past a beedi manufacturer from Uttar Pradesh was on a Parliamentary Committee, Instead of recusing himself from the proceedings of the committee because of direct conflict of interest, he made a forceful plea against the warming and influenced the panel to take a decision which favoured the tobacco industry. Clearly such conflict of interest interferes with unbiased public policy making and will not be based on objectivity.\n\nConflict of interest reduces public trust and confidence in integrity and impartiality of public functionaries. To deal with such a scenario the person who is found involved in such a conflict first need to identify the situation. All financial and potentially relevant non-financial relationships thus identified need to be disclosed to appropriate authority. For example it is well accepted norm for judges to opt out hearing of a case where his/her family members are involved.\n\nVarious oversight bodies, judicial institutions and commissions of enquiry could also be constituted for identification of any conflict of interest involved. We also need to move beyond treating conflict of interest as mere moral issue and should also take into perspective the legal angle. The priority must be to frame a modern law relating to conflict of interest, along the lines of what exists in the statute of the other countries like the United States.",

      "explanation": "**(a) Transparency** means sharing information and acting in an open manner.\u00a0 Transparency is essential for controlling corruption in public life, to uphold accountability and deliver information to stakeholders about the activities, procedures and policies of the Government. It also allows stakeholders to collect information that may be critical to uncovering abuses and defending their interests.\n\n**(b) Accountability** is the process whereby public sector organisations, and the individuals within them, are responsible for their decisions and actions and submit themselves to appropriate external scrutiny.\u00a0 Accountability is the fundamental requirement for preventing the abuse of power and for ensuring that power is directed towards the achievement of efficiency, effectiveness, responsiveness and transparency in civil services. It is needed to prevent covert unethical behaviour which would affect public service and due entitlements of stakeholders.\n\n**(c) Justice** means giving each person what he or she deserves while fairness is associated with an ability to judge without reference to one's feelings or interests. The principles of justice and fairness can be thought of as rules of \"fair play\" for issues of social justice. These principles of justice and fairness are needed in civil service to ensure that the common man receives his due without biasness, inefficiencies or greed of the civil servant affecting his entitlements.\n\n**(d) Courage of conviction:** In public service, while facing different situations one may be buoyed by the circumstances, fear, passions, greed since the decisions at the helm would be affecting many interests, vested or non-vested. It is during these trying moments that courage of conviction helps a civil servant to stay on the best course of action despite various temptations and risks, staying firm in his beliefs, values and duty. Hence, this quality assumes importance in public service.\n\n**(e) Spirit of Service:** Quality of being committed to public service without any self motives. The domain of civil service calls for duty in the spirit of service for country, society and its people and sacrifices by putting aside greed, personal entitlements and engagements. This is the single most important value that marks civil services apart from other service and keeps the civil servant motivated to keep working for the betterment of society.",

Despite, the territorial vastness of the empire, the state was dedicated to harmony and wellbeing of not only its subjects but even animals.\n\nThe above two examples bring out the contradiction in actions when guided by differing principles \u2013 one wherein, ambition based on weak principles resulted in harm to society (Hitler) and one where\u00a0 ambition based on ethical and moral principles led to development of society.\n\nThe role of parents and teachers in ensuring that the citizens of a country grow up as - ethical, moral, law abiding citizens with a strong knowledge base \u2013 cannot be overstated enough.\n\n**Role of Parents**\n\nParents, especially the mother, are called a child\u2019s first teachers.

Example- Gandhi through his close contact with his mother during childhood learnt and imbibed the moral values of truthfulness, non-violence through the stories of Ramayana and Mahabharata. These values instilled in Gandhi\u2019s thoughts, feelings and actions as a child, functioned as ideals and standards that governed his actions in the course of Indian freedom struggle.\n\n**Role of Teachers**\n\nTeachers have a very important responsibility of laying the foundation of an individual\u2019s future. They are the most important nation builders as they are not only responsible for the intellectual nourishment of young minds but also for moulding the overall personality of children. At young impressionable ages, teaching them about discipline, being responsible for their actions; inculcating values like team spirit, sharing, fair play, cooperation \u2013 a teacher sets the stage for a responsible citizen of the country.\n\nTherefore, the nurturing done by parents and teachers determines the course of a nation \u2013 whether it will be made of upright, moral and argumentative Indians or dull-minds ready to compromise on their ethics.",

      "explanation": "Emotional Intelligence can be defined as an ability to comprehend and manage one\u2019s emotions and also of others. It is important for making sound and objective decisions thus making it crucial for success as an administrator.\n\nEI can be applied to administrative practices in the following manner -\n\n* Being **self-aware** as an administrator helps us in having a clear picture of our strengths and weaknesses. If people are self-aware, they always know their feelings and how emotions affect the people around them.\n* Administrators must **self-regulate** themselves effectively. A self regulated administrator would not verbally attack others, make rushed or emotional decisions and/or stereotype people or compromise values\n* Administrators should constantly **motivate** themselves and their team members thus consistently working towards their goals. This also helps in maintaining an extremely high standard for the quality of their work.\n* Applying **empathy** in administrative practices is critical to managing a successful team or organization. Administrators with empathy have the ability to put themselves in someone else\u2019s situation.\n* By developing **social skills** administrators would also become great communicators thereby getting their team support and will also be good at managing change and resolving conflicts diplomatically.\n\nTo summarize emotional skills have gained foothold in the public administration sector and are essential for good administrative practices and customer service.",

      "explanation": "Peace is one of the foremost reasons why we engage in and maintain international relations. This is because, after the two World Wars, the appetite for war and violence decreased dramatically across the world. War became unethical behaviour, unfit for civilisation, hazardous for humanity. We needed to establish peace world over and in order to establish peace we need security. A secure and peaceful world allows us to preserve, protect and create newer solutions to our problems. Peace builds communities, expands trade, aids development, helps sustain the environment, and most importantly, helps us claim our socio-political rights.\n\nSecurity is derived from having strength. Strength in international relations is the ability to successfully negotiate in one\u2019s favour. Strength can be sourced from military power, economic strength, a \u2018soft-power\u2019 status etc. An ethical use of strength to negotiate for peace and security is ideally what is required in international relations, but such is not always the case. For example, China has been using its strength to claim territories of other countries in the South China Sea, which is nothing but an unethical use of strength, and as such may not lead to peace and security in the region.",

      "explanation": "A good life is the realization of all the values - material, social, psychological, aesthetical, moral, ethical and human. The classical Indian tradition follows the realization of the four purusharthas (pillars) \u2013 Dharma, Artha, Kama, and Moksha (religion, wealth, sensual pleasures, salvation).\n\nThe crisis of ethical values in modern life can be traced to the narrow perception in terms of material values i.e., Artha and Kama (wealth and sensuous pleasure) alone. The sole aim of all life has become attainment of personal success - defined in terms as acquisition of money, power and prestige. Its guiding slogan is, \u2018higher the quantity of consumption, better the quality of life\u2019.\n\nTherefore, the modern value crisis is mainly due to the narrow perception of a good life which overplays of the importance of material values of life and downplays other life values like the moral and ethical. Life values like happiness, peace, contentment, etc which give meaning, worth and fullness to human existence are seen as roadblocks and unnecessary diversions from the high road to material success.\n\nSince a narrow way of good life cannot sustain in the long-run, there is need for the society in general to focus more on the broader aspects of values to lead a better quality life.",

This shows that there has been no \u2018inclusive growth\u2019 in India.\n\nThe skewed income distribution patterns depict that the policy making in India has neither favoured the \u2018utilitarian approach\u2019 nor the \u2018common goods; approach.

    "solution": {
      "explanation": "(a) Discipline in an organization ensures productivity and efficiency. It encourages harmony and co-operation among employees and also act as a morale booster for the employees. Discipline is very essential for a healthy industrial atmosphere and for the achievement of organizational goals. However, the management of workplace discipline remains a key problem in employee relations, and is one of the most discernible sources of conflict at work.\n\nIt may also be counterproductive in an organization because it may create a culture of fear and apprehension, which lowers worker morale and inhibits employee growth. Using negative discipline to punish employees for poor performance is not as effective as helping them to identify their weaknesses and explore how to improve upon their strengths.\n\nTherefore while discipline is important in ensuring order and subordination, a fine balance needs to be followed so that it does not become counterproductive to the organisational interests. Positive discipline approach, which uses constructive criticism, can be followed to instill correct behaviour. For example explaining to an under performing employee how his/her failure to follow proper protocol is hurting her performance and then offer helpful suggestions for increasing productivity.\n\n(b)\u00a0Law, democratic government and market economy can be considered as three pillars of modern civilization. This argument can be tested on touchstone of Gandhian belief that moral values and obligations provide spiritual foundation of any civilization.\n\n**Moral Values and Law \u2013** Usually laws are public expression of morality which codifies the basic principle of conduct which a society accepts. Modern society has gradually replaced all those laws which were not in consonance with moral principles of recent times, for example slavery, which was once legal has been outlawed across the globe, respecting human dignity.\n\n**Moral values and Democratic Government \u2013** Democracy represents a set of decision-making institutions that embody respect for the equal worth of all citizens. This ensures that even powerless people get the right to express their preferences through democratic means. Values like equality, fraternity, liberty and justice are indispensible for proper functioning of a vibrant democracy.\n\nIt has been seen that whenever moral values and obligations were bypassed by democratic regimes, tyrannical leaders have emerged. This trend could be seen in many African democratic nations that compromise on moral principles in disguise of democracy.\n\n**Moral Values and Market Economy \u2013**\u00a0 Market economy is based upon efficient market functioning and self corrective mechanisms but there are instances when it has been observed that in absence of moral values the market economy created havoc. The global financial crisis (2008-09) was a result of keeping moral principles at an arm\u2019s length. Immoral principles like excessive greed and irrational exuberance where the unsustainable investment behaviour was observed raised a big question mark on basic principle of market economy.\n\nThese observations can be aptly summed up in the words of Gandhi where he contented that commerce without morality and politics without principles are sins.",

The National Building Code that provides guidelines for regulating building construction activities, are not adhered by builders.\n* Apathy towards laws make illegal construction a trend that continues to take life of innocent citizens.\n* Moreover, the standards prescribed for construction are at best poorly defined that people either do not understand or are not aware of.\n* Poor designs of buildings that could not withstand extra floors are also no less to be blamed. Poor quality materials used in construction makes any expansion a tough proposition.\n* At the root of such incidence is unplanned urbanisation that forces one to opt for accommodation that is built illegally on face of limited choices that people get in ever expanding urban areas.\n* Somewhere government has also failed in providing affordable accommodation to citizens hence they go for illegal properties.\n* Above all the builders\u2019 moral attributes are to be blamed in totality that finds it alright to compromise people\u2019s life in return for monetary gains.\n\n**Measures to prevent such occurrences\u2013**\n\n* First and foremost, rules and regulations need to be defined in clear terms and enforced effectively. Standards defined in National Building Code need to be effectively adhered to.\n* Those who break laws should be given stringent punishment to deter others from breaking such laws.\n* Citizens should be made more aware about laws and rules regarding construction activities, so that they avoid purchasing any such illegally constructed property/building.\n* Cr\u00e8che facilities and proper welfare mechanism should be put in place for children of women labourer working at construction sites.\n* Planned urbanisation will go a long way in addressing this concern. Satellite towns need to be built to ease the pressure on main cities.",

      "explanation": "Over the year the RTI act has emerged as a milestone in assuring transparency in administration and governance. It has provided a tool in hands of citizens to bring the best out of the government but in many cases the act has also served as a way to harass government officials and extort money.\n\nTo deal with such situations following measures are available \u2013\n\n* Those filing RTI applications may be asked to mention about any connection/interest they have in the concerned department. Applicants might be given options to specify whether information asked serves public purpose or private interest.\n\n* **Merit:** It might help to identify the persons who indulge in misuse of RTI and other wrong doing.\n* **Demerit:** It makes the process a little cumbersome for the genuine applicants.\n\n* All the previous applications under the RTI could be scrutinized to bring out the trends in asking questions so that genuine applications can be segregated from the non-genuine ones. Habitual offenders can be closely monitored.\n\n* **Merit:** It will help in creating a robust database of almost all applicants for the future reference of the department and also identify the miscreants.\n* **Demerit:** It will create extra burden on the employees of the department as they might have to take help of other departments and law and order agencies.\n\n* Few changes regarding charges and fees associated with providing information can be made in the law. There should be no changes in the fee for initial filing of the applications. But if they are found to be false or serving the vested interests of someone in later investigations, then a suitable monetary fine may be imposed.\n\n* **Merit:** It will act as a check on insincere and unscrupulous applicants and hit others economically for wrong doing.\n* **Demerit:** It will create a divide and discrimination between rich and poor people. Economically well off and non genuine applicants will not hesitate to file applications while the poor will be discouraged to do so.\n\nThe above steps will help in segregating genuine applications from the non genuine ones and will help take the effective actions accordingly. However in the given question, there are RTI activists who are attempting to extort money from the decision makers. It indicates the systemic flaws in the government department itself. Besides it points to the fact that decision makers want to hide the information as it might expose the wrongdoings in the governance. Therefore the governance itself should be reformed and transparency and accountability should never be forsaken. The genuine applicants must be provided with the requisite information. Better option would be to play a pro-active role and put most of the information that are not exempted under the act in the public domain for easy accessibility by public.",

      "explanation": "The term \u2018secular\u2019 literally means \u2018worldly\u2019 rather than \u2018spiritual\u2019, not relating to religion or bound by monastic restrictions. It means that the spheres of secularism and religion are distinct, independent, exclusive and separate without overlapping zones.\n\nThe Indian concept of secularism differs from western model of secularism as secularism emerged in the Western Europe as an opposite ideology to the church hegemony and as a protest against the wars and massacres in the name of religion. Secularism thus originated as an anti-religious principle. On the other hand, the Indian concept of secularism is not a rejection of religious practices. In Indian context, secularism means equal respect for all faiths and the state keeping itself impartial in not preferring one religion over other.\n\nSecularism in India does not stand for the abolition of religion, unlike in the West, but only for the separation of state from religion. While accepting the identities of various religious groups and their freedom to propagate, the Indian concept of secularism limits all those practices to the private life and negates every idea of mixing religion in the public life.\n\nThe uniqueness of Indian secularism is that it admits the freedom of religion, unlike its western counterpart that avoids religion. This religious freedom granted in the secular concept, makes the consolidation of religious people under one umbrella a reality in India.",

They are appointed by President, every 5th year or at such earlier time as he considers necessary.\n\nThe chairperson should be a person having experience in public affairs and the four other members should be from amongst the following:\n\n* a judge of high court,\n* a person with knowledge in governments finance and accounts,\n* a person who has wide experience in financial matters and administration,\n* a person with specialised knowledge in economics.\n\nThe Union Cabinet recently approved the setting up of the 15th Finance Commission with N.K. Singh as its Chairman for the period 2020-25.\n\n**Terms of Reference of 15th FC and Issues**\n\nThe Terms of Reference of 15th FC has proposed the performance based incentives for states but some of the Terms of Reference has led to concerns among various state governments:\n\n* Use of Census 2011 for distribution of tax revenue between centre and states:\n  + Previously FCs were using 1971 Census, but using 2011 Census might lead to smaller share of revenue for some states, mainly Southern States, which have stabilized their population over the period.\n* Progress made in promoting ease of doing business:\n  + This has raised concerns as this does not consider geographical limitations of a state.\n* Control over expenditure on populist measures by states:\n  + This appears to challenge the decision-making ability of state government. What may appear to be a populist measure, can also be a necessity in a particular state.\n* Examine whether revenue deficit grants should be provided at all:\n* Though in line with the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act, 2003, which recommends zero revenue deficit, it is important for states with persistent deficits.\n* Progress made by states in sanitation, solid waste management and bringing in behavioural change to end open defecation.\n* Achievements of states in implementation of flagship schemes of Government of India, disaster resilient infrastructure, sustainable development goals, and quality of expenditure.\n\nThe Constitution envisages the FC as the balancing wheel of the fiscal federalism in India. While it is expected to ensure that centre is not fiscally constrained given its role in key national public goods such as defence, at the same time it should give due share to state governments which play a major role in the Indian socio-economy.\n\n**Additional Information:**\n\nTerm of Reference (TOR) - The notification announcing constitution of each FC comprises terms that list out the Commission\u2019s work and considerations while making recommendations, is called the Terms of Reference.",

      "explanation": "Hunger is a stark and bitter reality for teeming millions in India who are caught under the \u2018poverty trap\u2019. It is also quite true that the single point focus on lack of availability of food as the prime reason for hunger has kept the ineffectiveness of human development policies in India in the background. Most of the poverty stricken households barely manage a difficult existence and struggle to provide their children with the nourishment they need to be healthy, happy and reach their full potential. Almost a third of Indian babies are born with low birth weight which is a very high number and reflects the ineffectiveness of human development policies in India. Lack of access to food, no access to drinking water, lack of sanitation facilities and gender inequity \u2013 all of these contribute to child malnutrition, which again stems from hunger and poverty.\n\nEnding hunger and malnutrition will not be achieved by focusing on food security and agriculture alone. Policymakers in India must acknowledge the critical need to link action in addressing food security to national strategies across sectors. There is a need to pursue a \u201czero hunger\u201d programme with no stunted children below the age of two. This should be a multipronged strategy that focuses on improving agricultural productivity, empowers women through support for maternal and child care practices, and offers nutritional education and social protection programmes. The nutrition mission must develop effective protocols for treating the acutely malnourished while ensuring better coordination between the nutrition and healthcare departments. India should adopt a zero tolerance mindset in battling hunger through long-term political commitment and effective human development policies that do not see hunger as arising only out of lack of availability of food. The country\u2019s serious hunger level is driven by high child malnutrition and underlines need for stronger commitment to the social sector and effective human development policies rooted in ground realities of India.",

(P5+1) and Iran, which limited Iran\u2019s nuclear programme and lifted the crippling economic sanctions, will have serious ramifications for nations having strategic interests in the West Asia.\n\nIndia\u2019s relations with Iran extend beyond the geopolitical and geo-economic binary. The cultural relations between India and Iran extend centuries, but the recent US behaviour has led India on crossroads. This controversy would affect India in following ways-\n\n* **Strategic Autonomy -** Strategic Autonomy has been the guiding principle of Indian foreign policy since independence. India maintains that it abides by only UN sanctions and not unilateral sanctions by any one country. In this case, US is coercing India and other countries to sever ties with Iran. This has direct implications on autonomous policy making.\n* **Oil Supply -** Iran has been one of the top three oil suppliers to India. Sanctions on Iran, which would be the next logical step by the Trump administration, will disrupt the crude oil supplies. US has presented India with shale imports, but the Gulf region has regional proximity to India. The withdrawal will also raise the crude oil prices, this fluctuation has a direct impact on the Indian economy (inflation, Balance of Payment, Current Account Deficit).\n* **Indian Investments -** India\u2019s plans to acquire stakes in Iranian natural gas field, build pipelines as well as develop the Chabahar port \u2013 a key Indian connectivity initiative \u2013 all stand to be seriously affected.\n* **Indian Diaspora -** In case this spirals out into direct confrontation between US allies and Iran, then lives Indians living in the Gulf region would be at stake. Their protection and evacuation would be a huge diplomatic and military manoeuvre.\n* **Terrorism -** Instability in the region has already resulted in rise of extremist group and more uncertainty will only provide them with more safe havens. This might have a direct effect on India\u2019s national security.\n\nOther partners of the agreement are willing to move forward despite the US withdrawal. India is an important stakeholder in the issue. So, India should work with like minded countries to defuse the situation and if possible, bring US back to the table if not, then prepare a separate mechanism for dealing with Iran including other stakeholders.\n\nIndia has always maintained that the Iranian nuclear issue should be resolved peacefully through dialogue and diplomacy by respecting Iran\u2019s right to peaceful uses of nuclear energy international community\u2019s strong interest in the exclusively peaceful nature of Iran\u2019s nuclear programme.",

It has followed pro-people approach where focus is to fulfill the aspirations of society as well as individuals.\n* **Pro-Activity:** Planning Commission in its plan provided for fixed five year plans depending on needs of nation. NITI Aayog is working on principle of pro-activity, where the problems faced by people are picked up and solutions are worked out. Activity of NITI Aayog is an ongoing process which is evident from its vision document and plans with milestone of 3 years, 7 years, and 15 years.\n* **Participation:** NITI Aayog while formulating policies, includes participation not only of in house members, union, and state ministers but it also includes domain experts from different fields. Planning Commission included only its in house members, and union ministers.\n* **Empowering women:** Policy formulation of NITI Aayog follows the principle of empowerment by inclusion of women in every aspect of decision making.\n* **Inclusion of All:** The vision and policy formulation of NITI Aayog is based on inclusion of all focusing on SCs, STs, Minorities, Poor, Villages, and Agriculturists, etc. Planning Commission focused primarily on overall economic development based on one size fits all principle, thus sometimes it led to exclusion of certain section of society.\n* **Equality:** The programmes like Atal Innovation Mission, SETU, etc., are based on principle of equality, providing opportunity to youth, and other sections of society.\n* **Transparency:** NITI Aayog through its basic principle of inclusion, \u2018more governance less government\u2019, equality, participation and empowerment tries to make government visible, responsive, and sensitive to the needs and aspirations of the people.\n\nWith the coming of NITI Aayog, there has been paradigm shift in planning process as the principles followed by it have nurtured and supported Cooperative and Competitive Federalism in India.",

The code of behaviour as enunciated in the Conduct Rules, while containing some general norms like \u2018maintaining integrity and absolute devotion to duty\u2019 and not indulging in \u2018conduct unbecoming of a government servant is generally directed towards cataloguing specific activities deemed undesirable for government servants.

There is no Code of Ethics prescribed for civil servants in India although such codes exist in other countries. There is need for more generic norms to be laid down by way of accepted conduct for the civil servants as recommended by the Hota committee.\n\n**Examples**\n\nCode of conduct include guidelines on acceptance of gifts by government servants and specific behaviour regulating codes (class I officer shall not permit son or daughter to take employment with a company with which she has official dealings\u2019 or \u2018acquiring immovable property with previous knowledge of prescribed authority\u2019 and so on).\n\nCode of ethics would include the principles of integrity, impartiality, commitment to public service, accountability, devotion to duty, exemplary behaviour etc.",

      "explanation": "Things that are not expressly forbidden by law or by clear implication are allowed in public administration. If the action promotes good and is not proscribed by any law or is not covered potentially by possible implication of conflict of interest, then it is permitted.\n\nFor public servants discharging their duties, the above statement provides a code of conduct for carrying out their responsibilities. \u2018Everything which is not forbidden is allowed\u2019 is also a constitutional principle of English law defining the essential freedom of citizens.\n\nThe conduct of a civil servant should be free of bias and prejudice. The overriding motive should be \u2018public interest\u2019 and conflict of interest should be avoided. As such, doing a good thing is allowed if there is no law against it and if there is no potential or perceived conflict of interest\n\nFor example, a public servant such as a District Magistrate endowed with the spirit of service may arrange for refreshment of senior citizens visiting the office for various services. Such a good gesture is not forbidden by law and does not appear to be influenced by any prejudice. Similarly, treating flood-affected victims with more kindness, empathy and understanding and going out of one\u2019s way to help them as long as it does not violate any law is another case of an act within the ambit of the spirit of the statement.",

      "explanation": "The means-ends debate is a paramount ethical dilemma. \u2018Ends justify the means\u2019 (Machiavelli) refers to a situation in which the final aim is considered so important that any way of achieving it is acceptable. Whereas, people like Gandhi firmly rejected the rigid dichotomy between ends and means to the extent that they believed that means and not the ends provide the standard of reference. Gandhi wrote, \u201cThe means may be likened to a seed, the end to a tree; and there is just the same inviolable connection between the means and the end as there is between the seed and the tree.\u201d\n\nThe answer to the question depends on what the ends or goals are and what means are being used to achieve them. If the goals are good and noble, and the means we use to achieve them are also good and noble, then yes, the ends do justify the means. But that is not what most people often mean when they use the expression. Most use it as an excuse to achieve their goals through any means necessary, no matter how immoral, illegal or unpleasant the means may be. Even Hitler believed that his means (holocaust) were justified for the ends of racial purity in Germany. The \u2018ends justifying the means\u2019 usually involves doing something wrong to achieve a positive end and justifying the wrong doing by pointing to a good outcome. There are certain things to consider in such a situation: the morality of the action, the morality of the outcome, and the morality of the person performing the action.\n\nIf someone is looking for a justification to their acts, it is often because they are doing something unethical. The \u2018means are of paramount importance\u2019, view is clearly more appropriate, ethical and desirable.",

      "explanation": "Some of the most common ethical dilemmas with which public servants are confronted revolve around aspects such as administrative discretion, corruption, nepotism, administrative secrecy, information leaks, public accountability and policy dilemmas.\n\nDilemmas could be overcome through an ethical decision\u2013making process. It is characterized as the course of the action of choosing from alternatives which are based on civil services values, moral responsibility and personal accountability of public administrators towards the society. The decisions have to reflect the respect for professional values, principles and norms.\n\n**A bureaucrat should answer the following questions:** Which are the main factors influencing the decision? What are its consequences? Who does the action benefit? Would the action embarrass the department or the society at large? Is the problem really what it appears to be? Is the action fully legal and ethical? These guidelines help to clarify whether the action is socially responsible. Though sometimes there is no clear answer to all questions.\n\nAll ethical and moral issues along with the public policies, laws, rules and regulations are to be kept in mind while resolving a dilemma.\n\nFinal decision and action after evaluation should be in consonance with laws and ethics.\n\nAnthony Makrydemetres sets out the ALIR model of imperatives of ethical reasoning - a set of basic principles that integrate and rearrange the process of dealing with ethical dilemmas. The four functionally related imperatives are: (a) the principle of democratic legitimacy and accountability of public bureaucracy and administration; (b) the rule of law and the principle of legality whereby law and only law should govern the administration; (c) the principle of meritocracy, professional integrity, autonomy and capacity of the administrative apparatus of the state; and (d) the principle of responsiveness and responsibility of administration to civil society.",

The world is not just black and white; there are shades of grey, thus public policies and decision-making have to be accordingly adjusted. Nothing is completely evil or totally good. One has to apply mind and find out if something has more bad (evil) in it or good in it. Most things have both bad and good in them and a good administrator must continuously examine them.\n\nGovernment policy is neither wholly good nor wholly bad. In that it could be good for many and bad for some and so on. Policy makers must analyze it, to find out what dominates. If the evil content is more than the good then such a policy course should be rejected; but if the good dominates, then it could be adopted or embraced.\n\nLincoln\u2019s statement could be seen in the light of dams and hydro-electric power projects in India. On one hand, they displace the tribals and uproot forests but on the other hand they bring electricity, infrastructure, employment and development. If the damages are more and cannot be offset by the possible good development then it is likely a bad course of action. Most public policy decisions could be analyzed in this light.",

During the process, he came across a form submitted by old couple seeking inclusion as beneficiaries in the scheme, but unfortunately they do not belong to reserved community which is one of the criteria for inclusion in scheme.\n\nThe stakeholders in the case are old aged couple who are from economically weaker section but do not belong to any reserved community. On other hand, there is competing rights of the old age people from reserved community.\n\nAs a district level officer, duty of Rakesh is to follow the rules and norms of the work but as a human and civil servant, he has responsibility towards citizens in general and old age people in particular.\n\nOn receiving the application, his immediate course of action should be to hold meeting with the surgeon who is willing to do the surgery free of cost. The prime focus during the discussion should be to know the details of condition of the applicant, his health, and kind of care required post surgery.\n\nAfter the said meeting with doctor, Rakesh should hold meetings with NGOs working in health sector for old age people and public spirited citizens. The course of action should be to crowd source funds to meet the incidental charges and providing post surgery care.\n\nRakesh should also forward an application to his superiors in the district with the details of the case requesting them, if possible, from DM welfare fund for financial support for this specific case.\n\nThese immediate steps are to ensure support to the couple in consideration. As midterm solution, Rakesh should try to organise awareness among citizens of district regarding Integrated Programme for Older Persons (IPOP). Secondly, he should hold meeting with NGOs, public institutions and public spirited citizens to organise outreach programme. He should make proposal and effort for proving space and creating awareness about PM Jan Aushadhi Kendra at District, Block and Village level.\n\nThis case cannot be taken in isolation as there would be many more poor people in need. Taking this case as base, Rakesh may propose his seniors to consider insertion of sub category for economically weaker section. Sub categorization can be considered as inclusive of landless poor, old people without children and people without any permanent source of income.",

Sufficient care was taken by the planners to make use of the government land with the minimum land acquisition from private parties. Compensation rate for private parties was also finalized as per government rules. Care was also taken to minimize deforestation. Once the project is announced, it is expected that there will be a huge spurt in real estate prices in and around that area.**  **Meanwhile, the Minister concerned insists that you realign the road in such a way that it comes closer to his 20 acres farmhouse.

He also tries to convince you by saying that there is no harm in it as he is buying the land legally. He even promises to supplement your savings in case you do not have sufficient funds to buy the land. However, by the act of realignment, a lot of agricultural lands has to be acquired, thereby causing a considerable financial burden on the government, and also the displacement of the farmers.

Moreover, my ethical values do not allow me to favour the Minister and thus I will stand with the original project.\n\n**Minister\u2019s interest vs. professional interest:** If I do not consider the Minister\u2019s proposal, it may cost me. Disregarding his wish will irritate him and I may have to pay a cost \u2013 maybe in the form of an unfavourable transfer. On considering his proposal, I will get benefitted in future with higher posts. But I will prepare myself for the impending situation and I will take the decision in favour of the society not the Minister.\n\n**My economic interest and that of minister vs. environment:** Our combined interest is very harmful for environment as it may result in cutting down of a large number of trees denuding the area of its green cover. As a responsible public servant, I shall keep aside the vested interests and shall consider the original project.\n\n**Minister\u2019s interest vs. financial burden on the Government:** Minister\u2019s proposal will cause financial burden on government as more money and labour will be needed for realigning the road. Instead, this money can be used for other welfare programmes.\n\n**Moral Conflict:** Till now, I have done my services on moral values and with honesty and accepting the offer will rob me of my mental peace. It will also degrade my values which are my pillars of strength. For fulfilling my economic needs, the salary provided to me from the Government is enough.\n\nGiven the above situation, I will ask the Ministry to announce the project with all nitty-gritties in public domain as soon as possible to minimize any kind of corruption. I will inform my seniors about the Minister\u2019s intention. If they help me then it\u2019s good, otherwise I will take help of NGOs and media houses to uncover the case. This will make moral and public pressure on the Minister to take back the proposal.",

      "explanation": "As evident, the issue of illicit distillation is not limited to law and order but expands to life and economy of the place. The problem of illicit liquor is directly linked with lack of social cohesion, poor economic opportunities and low awareness among people. Thus, in spite of all prohibition and ill effects, it is still in demand by the locals.\n\nBesides taking more stringent steps of legal nature which will work as last resort, there is need to initiate actions based on bringing attitudinal change; social persuasion; followed by ground level action by civil society and people themselves.\n\n**I will take following steps as Superintendent of district police:**\n\nMy first focus will be to eradicate the socio-economic disadvantages of the region. Looking from humanistic angle, it is generally found that psychological aspects are also involved in the given ill practice, where people in hardship find refuge in intoxication.\n\nI will promote the agricultural, small scale, and cottage industries. Promoting more participation of people in agricultural activities will act as motivation for more positive engagement and investment at right places.\n\nI will promote SHGs to cooperate with government and police department.\n\nI will deploy police personnel (without uniform) and volunteer groups at grass root level.\n\nAn app will be launched to report any illicit distillation, places of imminent dangers, violence, etc. The App is to be monitored by police for swift action.\n\n**Use of persuasion**\n\nI will also organise education campaigns at local level to instill awareness among people incentivise opening of small works of handicrafts, agricultural credits, etc. Besides, awareness campaigns in schools will also be organised, where parents will be invited and educative lectures and dramas on ill effects of liquor, and its impact on social-economic lives will be shown.\n\nStreet plays will be organized and community will be mobilized in support of liquor ban. By participating in street play, and listening to it, the consciousness of a person will be shaken and he can be reformed.\n\nI will encourage women to persuade their male family members against intoxication.\n\nThe prime motive is of total prohibition on illicit distillation but given the situation on ground, it is prudent to first pursue with socio-economic, psychological, and ethical considerations. Going by this, it will curb the demand of liquor by locals and would help in proper enforcement by taking legal recourse at last.",

      "explanation": "As a senior officer, it is my responsibility that the given issue should be addressed in such manner that the problem related to environment and health of thousands of citizens must be taken care of along with the issue of unemployment and industrial growth of state due to closing down of factory.\n\nSince the situation in state is volatile due to series of agitations, one of the quick solutions would be to close down the factory permanently. This will only solve the immediate existing problem of law and order by pacifying the public.\n\nHowever, doing so will adversely affect the employment and economic development of state. Also, since it is a big corporate, it can shift its plant to other state, leading to the same problems but at some other place.\n\nIt would be morally and ethically wrong for me to shift the problem to some other place and consequently putting the health of people there at risk rather than providing a sustainable solution for the existing problem.\n\nTherefore, as a responsible officer, I would like to suggest the following steps:\n\nFirstly, an immediate scientific assessment of damage done to surrounding environment should be done. The company, guided by local community, should take immediate steps to de-contaminate the site and surrounding environment.\n\nAs it is a large corporate, investment will not be an issue. It should set up state-of-the-art infrastructure facilities for effluent treatment. This will help bring down effluent discharge to permissible level recommended by Pollution Control Boards, which will not affect health and ecology adversely.\n\nSecondly, the company along with government should be asked to provide a monetary compensation for those affected, including those who were unemployed during closure of factory, in order to address their health problems and economic losses.\n\nThirdly, the company should be allowed to show the above expenditure in its Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) contribution, to provide reasonable relief to the company as well.\n\nFourthly, an investigation should be done to find out whether environmental rules were flouted while giving permission to set up factory ten years back or were there lacunae in the state\u2019s Environmental Impact Assessment norms which were used by company. At the same time the inspection should be done to find out that other companies are not flouting norms and polluting the environment.\n\nFifthly, a training programme should be institutionalized for state police to train them to handle large people\u2019s movement sensitively as the concerns of people protesting were genuine.\n\nAs per my understanding, this would be the best approach to deal with this issue as it creates a win-win situation for all the stakeholders - the company, the state government, the employees and most importantly the common people.",

      "explanation": "India, since Independence, has been following a peculiar nation of secularism, where all religions are treated equally and supported by the State. However, this concept, at present, is undergoing a paradigm change wherein Constitutional morality is being considered a significant component of secularism by the judiciary. Another characteristic of this change is the growth of misguided perceptions about secularism. The ultimate outcome of these changes is the rise of various challenges to our diverse cultural practices.\n\n**Thus, we have a logical classification of these challenges under two dimensions:**\n\n* **Challenges posed by misguided perceptions**\n  + **Religiousness is anti-secular and pro-fundamentalist:** Thus perception discourages various religious practices like rituals, clothing, thoughts etc. People who wear the saffron dress, who keep beard and pat skull cap (Taqiyah) and all considered fundamentalists.\n  + **Secularism is equated to atheism and apostasy:** Those who do not believe in good or abandon their religious beliefs are marked as secular. This thought is leading to a slow degradation of cultural practices.\n  + **Restrictions to food choices:** Some states, through following the majoritarian religious sentiments, restrict the sale of beef.\n  + **Judiciopapism:** Sometimes, the judiciary also takes a narrow glimpse of secularism and interferes into religious celebrations and practices. Ex. Rajasthan High Court\u2019s ban on Santhara and Supreme Court\u2019s ban on the sale of crackers on Diwali.\n* **Challenges due to rise of Constitutional morality**\n  + Following are the grounds of objections to several cultural practices as considered by the judiciary.\n  + **Right to Equality:** The practice of triple talaq and the ban on entry of women in Sabarimala temple were all declared unlawful by the Supreme Court. Those were done on account of gender inequality and gender exploitation inherent to these practices.\n  + **Animal Rights:** Supreme Court banned the traditional practice of Jallikattu because of the cruelty to animals involved in this.\n  + **Objection to Harmful Cultural Practices:** The illegality of female genital mutilation (FGM), practices in Dawoodi Bohra Community was brought into the limelight in 2018. The centre and the Supreme Court are having the opinion to ban this practice in India.\n\nThus, it is obvious that while some of the challenges are the outcome of the misleading notion of secularism, others are due to the exploitative and discriminatory nature of cultural practices only. The solution lies in getting all the stakeholders like religious leaders, judges, right\u2019s activists, civil society groups, NGOs and government representatives together over a common platform to discuss the challenges and to bring unanimity for preserving the cultural practices of our country.",

      "explanation": "Farmers\u2019 organizations are seen as a useful organizational mechanism for mobilizing farmers\u2019 collective self-help action aimed at improving their own economic and social situation and that of their communities. Such organizations are perceived to have the ability to generate resources, mobilise support and exert pressure with the help of their members. They operate at different levels from the local to the national.\n\n### Methods used by organizations\n\n* **Awareness generation:** They try to gain public support and sympathy for their goals and their activities by carrying out information campaigns, organising meetings, filing petitions, etc. Most of these groups try to influence the media into giving more attention to these issues.\n* **Lobbying:** Powerful farmers groups like sugarcane farmers of Maharashtra and UP try to influence policy making in their favour like getting favourable MSP and payment of arrears.\n* **Protest:** They often organise protest activities like strikes or disrupting general administration. These protests of late have centred around issues like loan waiver, higher MSP, free electricity, etc. The recent farmers\u2019 march to Delhi under the Bharatiya Kisan Sangh banner was such an example.\n* **Activism:** This method includes publicizing important issues, petitioning courts, preparing draft legislation and gaining public attention in matters related to farmers like issues pertaining to GM crops.\n* **Recent trends:** Farmers organisations recently have also employed innovative ways like spilling milk and vegetables on highways or appearing to consume dead rats, soil and urine at Delhi\u2019s Jantar Mantar etc.\n\n**However, these moves have hardly bore the desired results:**\n\n* In a situation of impending unrest the government often takes to populist measures instead of employing a solution which is good for the nation and the farmers in the longer run.\n* The government often takes short term respite such as farm loan waiver, higher MSP, cash transfers in farmers\u2019 accounts, etc.\n* Even if the government resorts to such populist measures its effective implementation is often absent. For example, rise in MSP is of no use if there lack of infrastructure to procure grains from the hinterland or if the masses are unaware of such a scheme.\n* Moreover, several policy recommendations have not been implemented as the government is not fully aligned with the suggestions. For example, the Swaminathan Committee recommendations is yet to be fully implemented.\n\nThus, although organising the protest and mobilising support help in gaining the attention of the public and the government, it can be argued that they have resulted in little on the ground.",

    "solution": {
      "explanation": "European countries like France have struggled to find a middle way between secularism and state religion that combines national and religious identity, and where ethnic and religious minority groups can co-exist within state\u2019s institutions. This can be seen in the banning of Islamic clothing, kosher or halal meals and burqas in France.\n\nBut India\u2019s experiences can perhaps shine a light to the rigid form of secularism practiced in France:\n\n* Although, the term \u2018Secular\u2019 was added to the preamble by the **42nd Constitution Amendment Act of 1976,** the spirit of secularism, derived from Indian cultural ethos, was implicit in it.\n* Indian philosophy of secularism is related to \u201cSarva Dharma Sambhava\u201d which means equal respect to all religions. The State maintains a \u201cprincipled distance\u201d from all religion and intervenes wherever necessary, for example -Sabarimala Temple and Triple talaq issue.\n* Like the French, Indians tend to consider secularism as part of their national identity. It is ingrained in both Constitutions but when it comes to treatment of minorities, ***French minorities feel targeted by \u201claicite\u201d(secularism) while Indian minorities see secularism as their best protection,*** thus preventing them from differential treatments and phobias.\n* In India, both state and religion can, and often do, interact and intervene in each other\u2019s affairs within the legally prescribed and judicially settled parameters.\n* As per the French model, the state cannot give any financial support to educational institutions run by religious communities. In India, educational institutions may receive assistance from the state.\n* In India, state has the policy of setting up Departments of Religious Endowments, Wakf Boards, etc. It is also involved in appointing Trustees to these boards.\n* **In France, the state** tries to push religion into the private sphere, where religious symbols can not be publicly displayed. Indian secularism has no such objectives and special rights are given to different communities, like- Muslims have personal laws and Sikhs are allowed to carry Kripans (Knives).\n\nWe may observe this from the fact that very few people in India were radicalised and joined ISIS as compared to their western counterparts. The concept of secularism prevalent in France has its roots in religious wars and discontent but Indian secularism has evolved in relative harmony and in light of great civilizational and cultural antecedents. Thus, Indian secularism is not an end in itself but a **means to address religious plurality** and aims to achieve peaceful coexistence of different religions. In times of globalisation, when almost all the countries have now become multi-religious, it is the need of the hour to learn from Indian secularism.",

      "explanation": "The Economic Survey 2018-19 states that the economy witnessed a gradual transition from a period of high and variable inflation to a more stable and low level of inflation in period 2014-18. However, in the current fiscal quarter, the headline inflation has fallen to the lowest value and also there is a reduction in Gross Value Added (GVA). This has raised various debates around the use of inflation targeted monetary policy and its impact on the overall economy.\n\n### Points to agree\n\n* **Provided policy stability:** Steady growth rate and low inflation has provided better market conditions for investment and production planning.\n* **More equitable:** Inflation impacts the poor more as it decreases their purchasing power. Low inflation increases disposable income and therefore increases investment in the economy.\n* **Maintaining the fiscal deficit to the appropriate level:** Controlled price level has helped in reducing subsidies and unnecessary tax cuts.\n* **Helping urban economy:** Low inflation rate has kept the living cost in urban areas to a manageable level. This has provided relief to the middle class.\n\n### Points to disagree\n\n* **Fall in consumption demand:** Decreasing Consumer Price Index (CPI) clearly shows the receding disposable income in rural areas which can be clearly seen in the Q2 GDP growth rate falling to 5%.\n* **Reduction in investment:** The contraction of the economy due to falling consumption has reduced the scope of further investment.\n* **Double Balance Sheet Problem:** Due to the slowdown, various corporates are facing the revenue shortage to pay back the interest, leading to NPA problem faced by the banks.\n* **Revenue Shortfall of the Government:** Due to less income generation in the economy, direct tax revenue has receded. This reduces government legroom for more public expenditure.\n\n### Way forward\n\n* **Increasing liquidity:** The recent step to slash the corporate tax and providing loans to MSMEs is the desired initiative to infuse more liquidity in the economy and increase investment.\n* **Increasing public expenditure:** Schemes like MGNREGS, rural housing etc. should be implemented more effectively so as to give a boost to rural income generation and thus demand creation.\n* **Promoting labour-intensive industries** such as Food Processing Industries, Leather Industries, etc. in order to create demand in the economy and provide employment to youths.\n\nCurrent monetary policy easing should be continued to give a renewed push to the investment cycle of Indian economy. Inflation is a double edged sword therefore a sustainable range of the inflation rate of 4-6% should be maintained so that maximum income generation could happen in the economy.",

    "solution": {
      "explanation": "The public expenditure management (PEM)is an instrument of state policy and mechanism for good governance. The broad objective of PEM is the achievement of overall fiscal discipline, strategic allocation of resources, operational efficiency and macro-economic stability.\n\n### Various challenges faced by the government with regard to PEM\n\n* **Global Shocks:** Global slowdown, Federal rates (for eg. reversal of quantitative easing), Trade wars, Oil prices etc. impact the budget estimates which in turn impacts the subsidies allocation and tax revenue collection.\n* **Narrow tax net:** More reliance on indirect tax makes the taxation policy more regressive. It also constrains the government to increase its social spending, which is low in India as compared to other major global economies.\n* **Less capital expenditure:** Budget\u2019s capital expenditure is essential to ensure inter-generational equity and competitiveness of the economy. It has remained around 10%-12% of government expenditure.\n* **Populist tendencies:** This leads to unproductive spending of the scarce government resources. For eg. giving tax sops, farm loan waivers in the pre-election period.\n* **Fiscal deficit:** Keeping the deficit within the desired limit is essential for maintaining the fiscal prudence.\n* **Managing public debt:** It is essential to ensure that the burden of the current generation\u2019s needs doesn\u2019t fall on the next generation.\n* **Trade deficit:** It should be reduced in order to have healthier global trade and improve market competitiveness.\n* **Containing inflation:** It is one of the most important objectives of monetary policy which is also impacted by the revenue and expenditure policies of the government.\n* **Estimates of revenue and expenditure:** In order to have effective PEM, comprehensive and realistic estimates of revenue and expenditure are essential. Currently, there is uncertainty in providing correct budget estimates.\n* **Ensuring equitable development across regions:** One of the pressing challenges faced by the government with regard to public expenditure management is to ensure equitable development across the regions.\n* **Inadequate capacity and efficiency of public institutions:** Substantive portion of budget allocation towards various schemes remains unutilized and underutilized due to poor implementation and structural bottlenecks. It leads to poor efficiency and cost overruns. For e.g. stalled road projects.\n\n### Government measures for effective PEM\n\n* **FRBM (Amendment) Act:** Government has targeted to reduce the fiscal deficit gradually and stabilize it by 2023 to 2.5%.\n* **Removing Plan/Non-plan distinction:** Removing plan/non-plan distinction and instead adopting the revenue-capital classification of public expenditure will help in allocation of more resources for creation of capital assets which in turn will help in improving the efficiency of economy.\n* **Monetary policy framework:** Inflation targeting by the Monetary Policy Committee has helped in price stability, which is key to effective PEM.\n* **Deepening of Fiscal Federalism:** More tax revenue has been devolved to states from the divisible tax pool. It would help in better allocation of scarce resources based on the needs of states.\n* **Monitoring system framework:** It has been developed at the central level to enable the outcome budgeting. Also, it enables the timely assessment of resource utilization. E.g. Public Financial Management System (PFMS).\n\nWith the 1991 reforms, the Indian economy was linked with the global economy. The effective PEM becomes more essential in this globalised era to meet various objectives of state policy. Various fiscal targets should be followed prudently and monitoring of resource utilization should be made robust.",

      "explanation": "**Carrying Capacity (CC)** can be defined as the population that can be supported indefinitely by its supporting systems.\n\n* In **ecological terms,** the carrying capacity of an ecosystem is the size of the population that can be supported indefinitely upon the available resources and services of that ecosystem.\n* In the broader sense, carrying capacity also means that all plants and animals which an area of the Earth can support at once. Change in carrying capacity for one species affects other populations in the area.\n  + A **simple example** of carrying capacity is the number of people who could survive in a lifeboat after a shipwreck. Their survival depends on how much food and water they have, how much each person eats and drinks each day, and how many days they are afloat. If the lifeboat made it to an island, how long the people survived would depend upon the food and water supply on the island and how wisely they used it.\n* **Sustainable development, which entails the maximum use of resources without damaging the system\u2019s regenerative capacity,** has a definite role to play in future policy planning. **Sustainability** requires managing all households -- individual, community, national, and global -- in ways that ensure that our economy and society can continue to exist without destroying the natural environment on which we all depend.\n  + **Population Control:** The notion that resource limitation must eventually constrain the growth of population is appealing, but appropriate estimation of regional carrying capacity would help to forge a definite course for planning.\n  + Women sensitization and education toward reproductive choices can play a dominant role in controlling pollution.\n* **Economic Planning:** By carefully assessing the present and future availability of local resources, economic zones can be planned, which will help in mitigating the adverse effects of economic activities.\n  + **For Example:** The establishment of Coca-Cola bottling plant in Plachimada, Kerala in 2000, resulted in the depletion of groundwater in the area and was shut down in 2004 due to widespread protest. Careful assessment of regional carrying capacity can help us prevent such incidents\n* **Agriculture Management:** The concept of carrying capacity of an ecosystem can be very useful in proper crop management across the length and breadth of the country. It has been found that farmers are overutilizing the capacity of land without giving any due importance to its regeneration, which has led to the problem of desertification in Punjab and Harayana.  \n  + **For Example:** Farmers in water stress areas of Maharashtra are growing water intensive crops which have created drought like conditions in the region. Prior estimation of carrying capacity can help avert such chronic conditions.\n* **Under-used capacity of Food Production & Biodiversity:** Using appropriate technological advancement, sustainability in food production methods and diversifying the use of biological resources can help attain harmony between natural resource and their utilization.\n* **Resource Management:** Adaptive management is the most widely accepted solution for confronting the unpredictability of renewable resources. Natural resource management must consider the ever-changing interaction between physical and biological systems, and react according to acquired experience and historical knowledge in a continuous, iterative learning process.\n\nThe current ethos of \u2018sustainable development\u2019 is slanted towards preservation of the replacement capability of natural systems, rather than maximum use. However, the unceasing growth of world population may eventually bring inequilibrium between the two. To face this future with confidence, humanity must endeavour to maintain the Earth\u2019s carrying capacity at a productive yet sustainable level, through improved logistical foundations, a more cooperative political climate, and better scientific understanding.",

      "explanation": "The fundamental principle in a democracy is that all persons holding authority derive it from the people; in other words, all public functionaries are trustees of the people. With the expansion of the role of government, public functionaries exercise considerable influence over the lives of people. The trusteeship relationship between the public and the officials requires that the authority entrusted to the officials be exercised in the best interest of the people or in \u2018public interest\u2019.\n\nOne of the most comprehensive statements of what constitutes principles of public life came from the Nolan Committee, which outlined the following seven principles of public life **Selflessness, Integrity, Objectivity, Accountability, Openness, Honesty, Leadership**.\n\n* **Leadership:** Holders of public office should promote and support the principles of public life by leadership and example.\n* For eg. Lal Bahadur Shastri used to fast every Monday to save grains for poor people of the country and he gave a call for the nation to follow it. Thus exhibiting a true example of how leaders should lead from the front.\n* **Selflessness:** Holders of public office should act solely in terms of public interest. They should not do so in order to gain financial or other benefits for themselves, their family or their friends.\n* For eg. Tukaram Omble of Maharashtra police tackled Kasab one of the terrorists of Mumbai attack so that he couldn\u2019t attack his fellow servicemen. Thus showing exemplary courage and the highest degree of selflessness by giving away his life for the cause of his nation.\n* Gita also in one of its shloka- karmanye vadhikaraste ma phaleshu kadachana reiterates the principle of selflessness which means one should only focus on our actions and should not worry about the result.\n* **Accountability:** Holders of public office are accountable for their decisions and actions to the public and must submit themselves to whatever scrutiny is appropriate to their office.\n* For eg. Vikram Sarabhai accepted the failure of ISRO first mission without actually putting it on the mission head (APJ Abdul Kalam). Thus taking full accountability for the failure of his team.\n* Thus it can be established that principles of public life are important for every democracy. Guidelines of public behaviour arising from such principles can play a crucial role in creating trust between the public functionaries and common public. Therefore any person who is privileged to guide the destiny of the people must not only be ethical but must be seen to practice these principles of public life.",

      "explanation": "A public servant is generally a person who is employed directly or indirectly by the government, either through appointment or election. A public servant values public good over his/her personal interests. Taxpayers and public funds partially or fully fund their wages, which is why they are known as servants of the public. The duties of public servants are as diverse as the duties and responsibilities of the government.\n\nThere are many elements which a public servant can imbibe to bring about a more humane and ethical governance structure. A few of these are:\n\n* Public Servants have an obligation to **protect and promote our constitutional ideals** enshrined in the preamble, to uphold the **rule of law**, dispense **administrative justice** and ensure **administrative facilitation**.\n* As an elite segment of society, public servants have an important role in informing and even formulating **public opinion** and perception on various issues.\n* The public servant should be **emphatic** as also advised by Mahatma Gandhi\u2019s that if anyone was in doubt if an action was good or not was to put oneself in the situation of the poorest of the poor in the country and see how a particular policy and programme will impact him or her.\n* S/He should also be **\u2018efficient\u2019** as administrators occupying positions of power and authority, it is their responsibility to translate policies into programmes, to implement schemes on the ground.\n* They need to be **agile in their thoughts and actions**. For eg. they should be able to access the latest information and knowledge and use them for improving service delivery.\n* They should be **impartial** and **incorruptible** as also observed by Sardar Patel and should work for an inclusive national development as mandated by the Constitution.\n* They should behave in a **dignified manner** and have the ability to **patiently** listen and take a balanced view. They must eschew arrogance and authoritarianism and be able to approach even the most intractable issues and irritants with a calm demeanour.\n\nKautilya in his Arthashastra emphasised on the importance of the common citizens: \u201cIt is the people who constitute a kingdom; like a barren cow, a kingdom without people yields nothing\u201d. Thus the success of the administration depends upon the involvement, commitment, dedication and sacrifice with which the public servants put their efforts for the welfare of the teeming millions in the country.",

      "explanation": "Effective utilization of funds for welfare services is one of the key tenets to ensure social and economic justice and meet developmental goals. However, as former Prime Minister Rajeev Gandhi had remarked, \u201conly 15 paise for every 1 rupee spent on public welfare actually reaches to the masses\u201d, thereby highlighting the gravity of ineffective utilization of funds in our country.\n\nPublic servants are the **trustees** of the hard earned public funds, therefore it becomes their moral and legal responsibility for their effective utilization. The various reasons due to which these funds are under-utilized and mis-utilized are given below:\n\n* **Under-Utilization:**\n  + High administrative cost and procedural delays in government offices which keeps the funds tied in administrative tangles and bureaucratic loopholes.\n  + Inappropriate budgetary allocation, for example: use of guillotine voting\n  + Lack of sufficient staff in government offices\n  + Improper technological penetration at grassroot level\n  + Ineffective decentralization of financial power\n* **Mis-Utilization:**  \n  + Corruption leading to diversion of funds to unauthorised sources.\n  + Poor accountability mechanism preventing their effective monitoring and utilization.\n  + Lack of coherence in planning.\n  + Ineffective decentralization of power\n  + Populist politics in the country.\n  + Corporate impact on policy makers i.e crony capitalism\n  + Favouritism and misuse of office i.e favouring someone over others while allocation of government projects.\n  + Expenditure rush during the month of March, popularly known as **\u2018March Rush\u2019**, which leads to unplanned and improper fund expenditure, to prevent lapsing of funds that have remained unutilized.\n  + Diversion of funds to other purposes.\n\n### Implications\n\n* **Social:** Violation of the rights and entitlements of the masses. It leads to social problems like inequality, illiteracy, poor health and sanitation, increased animosity among different communities etc.\n* **Political:** Misallocation and underutilization has led to unequal development in the country, increased corruption and inequality within different states. This has created the problems of regionalism, naxalism, and separatism.\n* **Economic:** India\u2019s continuous struggle with poverty and inability to build on its demographic dividend has been the major impact. Inspite of having a potential of double digit growth, our growth story still revolves around 7%, along with inadequate improvement in infrastructure, human indices, employment etc.\n* **Ethical:** Breach of **\u2018Doctrine of Public Trust\u2019** which lays responsibility on public servant for judicious use for the benefits of the masses.\n\nNo matter how good the policy we frame, its impact drastically depends on the allocation and effective utilization of funds. Therefore, to realize the ethical and moral duty incorporated in Directive Principles of States Policy to maximize welfare measures and prevent concentration of wealth in few hands, it is important to take appropriate policy measures to realize the goals of national development.",

      "explanation": "Transparency International regards corruption as abuse of power which erodes the fabric of society. It undermines people\u2019s trust in the political system, in its institutions and its leadership. A distrustful or apathetic public can then become yet another hurdle to challenging corruption.\n\nAll civil servants are entrusted with public duty for the welfare of the masses. Negligence to the public duty cost masses by loss of their freedom, health, education, rights and even life sometimes, and hence, nonperformance of duty by a public servant is also a form of corruption. For example: A **doctor** not reaching hospital on time threatens the life of the patients, a **teacher** not performing his duty not only endangers the future of children but of society as a whole and a **police officers** not doing what is mandated in riotous situation leads to loss of life.\n\nCorruption amounts to breach of faith reposed by the public in civil servant and violation of the rights of individuals. It presents a roadblock to effective administration, law and order, failure to achievement of objectives of welfare policies and eventually guarantee of realisation of constitutional goals like social, economic and political justice.\n\nNon-performance of duty by public servants for which they are morally, legally and constitutionally mandated to do, is a form of corruption as the **Prevention to the Corruption Act** considers non-performance of public duty as an offence.\n\nTherefore, it is essential for every civil servant to perform their duty as mandated in order to uphold the constitutional values and become a vehicle for change in the life of masses, so that common public can enjoy what they are entitled to.",

      "explanation": "*There is a higher court than courts of justice and that is the court of conscience. It supersedes all other courts.* *\u2014 Mahatma Gandhi*\n\n### Crisis of Conscience\n\n* It is the dilemma of being ethically unfair or wrong in the decision making process.\n* Sometimes in complex and emotional situations, it is very hard to decide what is the right thing to do. The situation might need a different solution practically which might be immoral but our conscience strongly suggests us a completely different approach.\n* It is ethically proper to violate an ethical principle only when it is clearly necessary to advance another true ethical principle which will create the greatest amount of good and the least amount of harm to the greatest number of people, which is the utilitarian approach.\n\n### How does it manifest in public domain?\n\n* It manifests in the decision making process by civil servants where the decision can impact a huge number of people. The problem arises when they are pressurised under some ministerial influence to take immoral decisions or implement unethical policies.\n* It manifests in the tussle between ethics and the law. For example, restricting public movement in Kashmir for upholding law and order raised the situation of crisis of conscience. Similarly, despite having a legal status as a third gender, transgenders continue to face oppression, marginalisation, lack of employment opportunities which forces them to resort to beggary, and this failure to ascertain to them life of dignity is a manifestation of the crisis of conscience in public domain.\n\nIt is common to come across such crises of conscience in public domain where lives and decisions overlap and come face to face almost every time. The key to overcome such crisis of conscience for public servant is through keeping all dimensions in mind, freeing himself from desires or pressures and staying calm & true to public service ethical code and legal framework.",

Integrity, rectitude, uprightness etc. It is the presence of procedural integrity with high standards of ethical behaviour.\n\nProbity in Governance additionally elucidates that rather than the conventional civil service values of performance, integrity and patriotism, it\u2019s vital for civil officials to adopt as well as undertake ethical and integrity values, which includes respect for human rights, morality in public life and compassion for the downtrodden and dedication to their welfare.\n\n**Probity in Governance seeks to fulfil the following purposes:**\n\n* It preserves public confidence in Government processes\n* It maintains integrity in public services\n* It ensures accountability in governance\n* It ensures compliance with processes\n* It seeks to avoid the potential for misconduct, fraud and corruption\n\n### Measures to Ensure Probity in Government\n\nLack of probity in governance has become one of the biggest menaces of society. To inculcate probity & adherence to ethical practices among them certain strides could be taken:\n\n* A dedicated unit to oversee violation of Code of ethics & Code of conduct by government officials be set up both at state and centre level.\n* Information must be made accessible to common public through websites.\n* Mandatory declaration of assets and liabilities of government employees, accompanied by proper auditing.\n* Establishment of Independent Anti-Corruption Agency\n* Citizens Advisory Boards to incorporate ideas of common public in improving governance.\n* Mandatory Social Audit of all government programs, for example: Meghalaya has passed a law for social audit of government programs.\n\nApart from laws and policies, the government should also focus on bringing **behavioural change** in government employees so that they can easily empathize with the problem of common mass so as to fulfil the democratic goal of \u201cgovernment by the people, for the people and to the people\u201d.",

      "explanation": "Emotional Intelligence (EI) refers to the ability to understand one\u2019s own emotions and those of others to regulate and manage them and utilize them to execute tasks. It is the basis of the social skills of administrators that contribute to organizational effectiveness.\n\nThese set of skills are imperative to deal with the challenges of administration such as political interference, communication with people and conflict management.\n\n**E.I. works in your favour in the following manner:**\n\n* It helps in maintaining objectivity while dispensing work\n* It leads to efficient and desired outcomes.\n* Increases trust among colleagues.\n* Reduces stress and any extreme outburst.\n* Helps in understanding the state of mind of others.\n* Prepares you to deal with unexpected circumstances.\n* Emotional Intelligence could help an officer to be motivated and to inspire her/his subordinates to execute the given tasks efficiently.\n* **In Decision making,** Emotional Intelligence helps civil servant in restricting the overflowing of their emotions and keeping their temperament under control in case of any unwarranted influences.\n* Moreover, EI helps the civil servant to have an empathetic attitude towards the common people, especially poor and vulnerable ones.\n\n**Eg1:** If you had a fight at home just before coming to office, then there is a strong possibility of a spillover of the bad mood at workplace in the form of shouting at the colleagues or being rude and excessively defensive. But, if you are good at E.I., then you\u2019ll calm yourself down, managing your extreme emotions. This will assist you in better discharging your duties to the best of your capabilities.\n\nSo, this way , you moulded your emotions to work for you, rather than letting them create a hindrance for you.\n\n**Eg2:** Suppose, you are supervising a very important project in the public domain with a strict deadline. As the deadline approaches, if you have low E.I. you will get easily agitated, anxious, frustrated, discouraged and pessimistic. This will create further obstacles for your projects.\n\nBut, if you have high E.I. then you will excel, motivate your team members to expedite the work, will calmly think of other innovative ways to hasten the work through a positive outlook and happy disposition.\n\nThus, E.I. helps in curbing the randomness and extremity of emotions. This further leads to a positive perspective and stable performance rather than creating any hindrance which may go against us.",

      "explanation": "An unexamined human life, is deprived of the meaning and purpose of existence. The ability to introspect removes the individualistic absurdity by invoking a commitment to moral integrity and social solidarity.\n\nJust like a seed needs soil, sunlight and water for its germination, human life needs introspection and examination for its growth. An understanding of the experiences gained in the life at any particular time, enriches one\u2019s engagement with self and the universe.\n\nMahatma Gandhi\u2019s examination of self through his autobiography \u2018My experiments with truth\u2019 highlights the significance of reflection on life. Mahatma Gandhi was not only able to map his weaknesses and vulnerabilities through the examination, but was also able to question his prejudices and understand his strength as a human being.\n\nThis very ability to reflect on life adds more depth to the character of \u2018Arjun\u2019 in Mahabharat than most of the other characters like Bheeshm, Yudhishthir or the Kauravs. Instead of following the norms and fighting with his clan, Arjun questions the meaninglessness of the war and the purpose of his life.\n\nThe fast changing societies and consumerist culture in the contemporary world leave less time for human beings to examine and think about the changes. Adaptation to changes have become automatic and unquestionable.\n\nThe quotation has strong relevance in the present times where human beings are burdened with the histories of war, colonisation, nationalisation, erosion of morality in the scientific and technological advancements and the sense of spiritual uprootedness.\n\nIt is in these times that one needs to delve deeper into the conscience to find the purpose of existence and engage in a more meaningful manner with the society.",

Leaving thousands unattended, when they are completely dependent on government help, would be an act of timidity and self preservation which is unbecoming of a public servant.\n\n**Morale upliftment:** The primary response for me, as the head of the rescue mission, is to reorient the focus of the group towards our real objectives. Since some of them are requesting to call off the mission I need to exhort them, with examples like \u2013 **During the 2014 Floods in Kashmir,**when the NDRF team started rescue mission, they were pelted with stones,their boats were snached and one of them was stabbed but they did not yield and went on to rescue more than 50000 people.\n\nInitially, when **Mahatma Gandhi was marching barefoot in riot hit areas of Noakhali,** his path was strewn with **pieces of glass and animal excreta** by the riot-affected people. Later, His unflinching courage and love for humanity created a miracle, when people themselves promised not to retaliate.\n\nHere, the anger of people is misplaced due to the popular perception of government servants. Once, people witness self-abnegation, dedication and courage in the rescue work they will start cooperating.\n\nSecondly, I would try to persuade people by taking help from those who are willing to cooperate, in such an exercise local leaders can also help.\n\nApart from this, I will try to get cooperation from the government with respect to protection of my team members so that they may not be hurt in helping the people.\n\n### Qualities required to effectively manage such situation\n\n* **Spirit of service:**Since the rescue team is vulnerable to physical and verbal attacks,only some higher cause can help an officer in composed and coordinated rescue work.\n* **Leadership:**In such circumstances,finality of any decision lies completely on the wisdom of the leader.He/She also needs to lead the team from the front; displaying personal courage and conviction.\n* **Empathy and Emotional Intelligence:**An officer needs to have empathy and emotional intelligence for understanding the behavior of disgruntled local people otherwise one may abort the relief mission or resort to use of force-which will only heighten their anger.\n* **Power of persuasion:** People seething with anger are reactive and short-sighted, making them agree for something requires the power of persuasion.\n* **Patience and Presence of mind:** A Public Servant can not afford to make spontaneous decisions in such situations. Any further course of action should be guided by considerate assessment and swift thinking.\n\nThus, we need to have a sensitivity of the situation and not blame people for their reactions. Empathy and support is the key to rescue people in problems.",

      "explanation": "The role of civil servants is to take decisions which have huge ramifications on the socio-economic growth of the country. However, instances of wrongful prosecution of honest officers deeply impact the morale of honest officers. It has multiple effects on the functioning of civil services in India:\n\n### Affect on the functioning of the civil services\n\n* **Impact on decision-making of officers:** Officers will be averse to expressing their views. This may further aggravate red-tapism due to fear of departmental action for their incorrect decisions.\n* **Hampers economic growth:** With increasing private sector participation in public services, fear of prosecution may restrict honest officers to take progressive, bold and courageous decisions across sectors. Delay in taking key decisions will lead to poor governance.\n* **Tool to harass honest officers:** Corrupt political leaders and bureaucrats may harass honest officers through baseless complaints and investigations.\n* **Impact on reputation of honest officers:** Prosecution of honest officers leads to mental agony and heavy financial loss besides being defamed in the society.\n\n### Measures to ensure that honest civil servants are not implicated for bonafide mistakes\n\n* **Ensuring maximum transparency in administration:** The key policy making decisions should be made ensuring maximum clarity and openness about how decisions are taken. This will prevent blaming select individuals for incorrect decisions.\n* **Legislative actions:** As recommended by the **Hota Committee report,** amendment to Section 13(1)(d) of Prevention of Corruption Act , 1988, that deals with criminal misconduct by a public servant is a welcome step. It will protect honest civil servants from malicious prosecution and harassment.\n* **Reducing politicization of bureaucracy:** The fear of transfers, denial of promotions, or being punished post retirement may impact decision making of officers. Ensuring fixed tenure to civil servants is a much needed step for systemic reforms in civil services.\n* **Role of institutions:**\n  + **Approach of judiciary:** In a democracy and a rapidly growing economy, courts have to make decisions with a very constructive interpretation of laws. It must clarify the distinction between corruption and wrong administrative decisions.\n  + **IAS Association** of India and other **civil society** groups should support and stand by honest officers undergoing wrongful prosecution.\n  + **Creating internal oversight mechanisms:** Internal enquiries in each department should consider integrity and past career record of officers before recommending for criminal investigation of bonafide decisions.\n\n### Justification\n\n* Since every decision taken may not prove to be correct in the long run, it is unjust to prosecute honest officers for genuine mistakes. Young and aspiring civil servants should preserve the key values of honesty, impartiality and fearlessness.\n* Dynamic and honest officials, who are risk-takers for the greater good, must be encouraged, not restrained. No bureaucrat or public official should be fearful for a bona fide decision.\n* Officers must stick to honesty and righteousness and ultimately there is victory of right over wrong. As the national motto suggests \u2013 ***Satyameva Jayate:*** Truth alone triumphs; not falsehood.\n  + **For ex:** Former coal secretary HC Gupta who is known for his integrity and clean career record was acquitted by the Delhi High Court after CBI failed to prove the charges of criminal misconduct against him in the coal scam.\n\nThus, the need of the hour for the civil servants is to follow the code of ethics along with code of conduct.",

Gandhiji considered \u2018commerce without morality\u2019 as one of the seven social sins.

Civil servants should be given proper training to ensure citizen-friendly behaviour.\n* **Strengthening the ethical competence of civil servant.**  \n  + **Training and performance appraisal:** This would incentivise the honest civil servants and make them role models for others to emulate.\n  + **Reward and honours:** It will infuse competition in the civil services to perform better and develop innovative solutions for public service.\n  + **Promotion of inclusive work culture:** Diluting strict hierarchy to increase the cooperation among public officials to increase the effectiveness of services.\n  + **Social and cultural competence:** This would help the civil servant to understand the diverse Indian society and perform as per the high aspirations of the public.\n* **Developing administrative processes and practices which promote ethical values and integrity in civil services.**  \n  + **Promoting accountability:** Effective laws which require civil servants to give reasons for their official decisions. For eg. RTI act.\n  + **Reducing Corruption:** Punitive provision like Prevention of Corruption Act and Whistleblower Protection act, technological Interventions in the form of e-governance to remove discretion, promotion of Social Auditing etc to ensure accountability of the administrative work.\n  + **Human Resource management strategies:** Performance-based pay, Lateral Entry, Multi-Phase training will increase the efficiency and quality of public service delivery.\n  + **Internal and External Committees:** To ensure redressal of complaints and grievances of civil servants and public. This improves the work culture and aligns the behaviour of public servants to the desired civil services values.\n  + **Code of Conduct Rules:** It ensures appropriate behaviour from public servants that should be unbiased and non-partisan.\n\nPromotion of ethical behaviour and integrity in civil servants, and revamping the public administration is critical to ensure that the policies of social welfare are implemented in true spirit. It would improve the responsiveness of public servants towards the common citizenry. Also, public trust would increase in the government setup. Greater social capital can in turn help in the promotion of ethical governance.",

      "explanation": "\u201cIndia is the cradle of the human race, the birthplace of human speech, the mother of history, the grandmother of legend, and the great grandmother of tradition. Our most valuable and most artistic materials in the history of man are treasured up in India only.\u201d \u2013 Mark Twain.\n\n* India has long been considered as the most pluralistic and diversified society in the world. Her past is full of amalgamation of foreign tribes with indigenous ones. This amalgamation created a unique synthesis of cultural traditions and customs. The present-day Indian society is a continuation of these traditions.\n* Eversince globalization, beginning from the 18th century onwards, Indian society is constantly interacting with other global societies and exchanging customs and traditions more rapidly.\n* The reactions to global events are clearly manifested in Indian society. For example, religious fundamentalism has gained ground in India. The ISIS militant group has seen participation from Indian youths as well. Religious brainwashing through misinformation has eroded religious fabric. The communal riots have also been recorded in many parts of India. As a counteraction to this, various hardline groups have also emerged among other sections.\n* Moreover, religious conversion movements have also sparked debates as cases of forcible conversions and conversion through monetary incentives are recorded.\u00a0 Some of them have been most active in Tribal areas and Northeastern part of India. Their distinct culture and traditions are impacted by these activities. Further, the ridiculing of ancient Indian traditions in the name of modernity and westernization has also been on rise.\n* However, globalization has also contributed to women empowerment and has putsome of the mostregressive Indian traditionssuch as Sati and Purdah on a rational test. Also, it has helped to export our cultural practicessuch as cuisine, dances, and various other art forms, etc. all over the world particularly Yoga. This, in turn, has boosted tourism in the country and resulted in generation of even more unique customs and traditions.\n* Thus, spaces where unhindered access to global forces is given, there have been cases of violation of India\u2019s diversity and pluralism. But on the other hand, active participation from Indians and foreign elementsin a healthy environment has resulted in exchange of information and promotion of Indian culture.",

      "explanation": "* Obscurantism is described as the practice of deliberately presenting information in an imprecise and complicated mannerso that a smaller number of people understand and investigate further on the subject matter. In other words, it is the way to limit transfer of knowledge beyond certain limits. Obscurantism has remained a common feature in almost all religious beliefs.\n* Custom and tradition refersto a common way of doing activities and which are being practiced for a long time. These activities vary from marriage, divorce, way of worship to other rituals and ceremonies. It has been noticed thatsome ofthe old customs and traditions are neitherlogical nor even reasonable inmodern context and therefore are also not acceptable in the morals of contemporary society.\n* The modern reformers demand to do away with such customs and traditions and put an end to long perpetuating orthodox dogmas. But to avoid any changes in old customs and traditions and to maintain their authority the socalled religious punditstry to practice obscurantism so that information about customs and traditions of a religion is less delineated and hence less reform in the religion is demanded by the society.\n* For example, the evil traditions of nikah halala and triple talaq propagated for so long in India despite the tradition being illogical and unreasonable, just because of obscurantism by the Muslim Personal Law Board. Similarly, customs like Sati and child marriage were perpetuated for long because of obscurantism. The tradition of animalsacrifice in ceremoniesisstill practiced in many religions. The custom of Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) isstill practised by few communities. Similarly,the customslike polygamy and polyandry are still a common practice in many cultures because of obscurantism.\n* Nevertheless, customs and traditions form an important part of human civilization and help people to align themselves in closely knit bonds. Further, these customs and traditions are not cast in stone. By their very nature, they are supposed to evolve constantly and meet the changing requirements of time and social contexts. Humans have intrinsic rights to decide which customs and traditions to preserve or revise or even discard.",

      "explanation": "The doctrine of separation of power divides the state into three branches \u2013 the legislative, executive and judicial \u2013 and gives each the power to fulfil different tasks.\n\n* The executive is vested with the power to make policy decisions and implement laws.\n* The legislature is empowered to issue enactments and review the functioning of the executive.\n* The judiciary is responsible for adjudicating disputes. The judiciary also exercises judicial review over the executive and legislative action (Article 32 and 226).\n* The separation of powers is important because it provides a vital system of \u2018checks and balances\u2019.\n\n**Judicial Legislation**\n\n* Making law is the domain of the legislature. But occasionally, the judiciary has issued guidelines and made policies in the cloak of judgments, assuming the power of the legislature.\n* For example, in Arun Gopal case (2017), the Supreme Court fixed timingsfor bursting Diwali fireworks, although there are no laws to that effect.\n* In M.C. Mehta case (2018), the court annulled the Rule 115(21) of the Central Motor Vehicle Rules, 1989, when it directed that only BS-VI vehicles can be sold after March 30, 2020.\n\n**PIL and Judiciary**\n\n* Public Interest Litigation (PIL) is filed for the protection of \u201cPublic Interest\u201d, such as pollution, road safety, constructional hazards etc.\n* The judiciary has been compelled to intervene in the domain oflegislature and issue guidelinesto the executives due to several reasons such as:\n  + When the legislature fails to make the necessary legislation to suit the changing times.\n  + When authorities fail miserably to perform their administrative functions sincerely.\n  + When the fundamental rights of the people are threatened by the state.\n* For instance, in Vishaka case (1997), the judgement recognized sexual harassment as a violation of the fundamental rights.The guidelines also directed for the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013.\n* In K. Puttaswamy case (2017), the Court pronounced that the right to privacy is intrinsic to the right to life and provided the three step test to decide on the constitutionality of any law infringing privacy.\n\nThus, though Judicial Legislation is antithetical to the doctrine of separation of powers, sometimes it becomes justifiable for the judiciary to issue guidelines to executive authorities. Nevertheless, with a view to see that judicial activism does not become judicial adventurism, the courts must act with caution and proper restraint.",

One ofthe primary objectives of inter-generational equity isthe sustainable use ofresources by one generation to enhance economic sustainability for the future generation.\n* Inter-generational equity has become crucial in the present times, due to the growing imbalance in the distribution of resources, ongoing degradation of environment and overexploitation of resources.\n* This imbalance is more profound between the developed and developing nations or between the Global North and the Global South. Moreover, the developed countries are today unwilling to help developing countries adapt and mitigate climate change impacts.\n\n**Intra-generational equity and issues**\n\n* Progress of a society should be determined by the state ofthemost vulnerable and the weakest ones: Mahatma Gandhi\n* The concept of intra-generational equity provides rights and duties to every person of a single generation to use and take care of the resources justifiably so that benefits are reaped by every section of society.\n* In order to promote intra-generational equity, the concept of social justice is propagated.

Additionally, larger compounds which are commonly not dialyzable can be removed.\n\nBecause of their small size, much concern has been expressed about the potential for adverse health effects arising from the ability of nanoparticles to penetrate cell walls and the blood-brain barrier.

      "explanation": "Comprehensive National Power (CNP) is the comprehensive capability of a country to pursue its strategic objectives by taking the necessary actions internationally. It can also be defined as the degree of ability to mobilize and utilize strategic resources of a country to realize national objectives.\n\n**Role of ethics and values in enhancing human capital**\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n* Ethics is all about the choices that an individual makes. People always face many dilemmas and choices that affect the quality of their lives.\n* Ethics and values make an individual aware that their choices have consequences, both for themselves and others.\n* Thus, ethics and values build credibility, improve decision making, and provide long term gains.\n\n**Role of ethics and values in enhancing social harmony**\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n* Ethics and values are about character; the sum of qualities that defines a person. The same principle applies to society.\n* Ethics and values develop norms of behaviour that everyone should follow in society. If every person acts with a selfish motive, society might fall into chaos and anarchy.\n* There is nothing wrong with pursuing one\u2019s interests. However, an ethical person must be willing \u2013 at least sometimes \u2013 to place collective interests ahead of self-interest.\n\n**Role of ethics and values in enhancing soft power**\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n* International relations are largely driven by the ideology of realism, which propagates national interest precedes global interest.\n* However, pursuance of national interest must not always be fulfilled with hard power (military power, economic power). The soft power (a country\u2019s image due to its culture and values) also secures national interest without compromising others\u2019 interest.\n* In this regard, ethics and the country\u2019s ancient values (for example, the idea of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam in India) revive national pride and project a country\u2019s rightful image.\n\nEach country wants to have a respectful place in the global community. CNP is about pursuing it with the right course and action. Each citizen is a nation-builder, and their ethical righteousness help a country achieve wider acceptibility.",

      "explanation": "Hatred is a strong negative emotion or extreme emotional dislike that can drive oneself to extreme behaviors such as violence, murder, and war. It is corrosive of a person\u2019s wisdom and a nation\u2019s spirit. In the contemporary world, religious violence, communal polarization and intolerance have increased and it is a continuous obstacle in the progress and growth of a country.\n\nOne of the characteristics of hatred is the need to devalue the victim more and more.\u00a0 At the end, the object of the hatred loses all moral or human consideration in the eyes of the hater. Hatred severely destructs person\u2019s wisdom and conscience as:\n\n* Hatred produces energy for destructive power and the fission that ignites the explosion, which is driven by the intense hostility, fear, anger or sense of injury one feels.\n* Hatred reduces an individual\u2019s quality of making good judgements or having good experience and knowledge.\n* It further reduces an individual\u2019s quality of being wise.\n\n**Hatred may also lead to:**\n\n* **Deprivation of Amenities**: Victims of intolerance are found to be deprived of facilities and opportunities, thus excluding them from contributing to the overall development of the society and subsequently lose out on self-development too.\n* **Curbing of Individual Freedom**: Any form of illogical intolerance often leads to taking away individual freedom and rights. Constructive criticism and debates over various aspects are absent and dominance of one ideology takes over. Any society plagued by this halts the overall growth and progress of the collective.\n* **Destruction of Social Harmony**: Due to the communal intimidation and hatred being spread, the very fabric of a society is being diminished in the larger sense, rendering a weak and divided social strength. For example: Assimilation with accommodation, stable patterns of pluralism, inequality and integration etc. constitute the basic fabric of Indian society, which when tainted with communal intolerance get divided and internally threatened.\n* **Economy**: Disturbances caused due to communal intolerance largely impact the local economy due to the disruptive activities like strikes, riots, destruction of public property, etc. against each other, and also disturb the macro-economic outlook of countries on the global sphere as a result of the apprehensions of investors or economic giants of a good work environment.\n* **Political Instability**: At times massive such clashes result in political blame game, interference, and unnecessary measures, projecting an unstable political atmosphere. Welfare of the nation is mainly side-lined, and the representatives are caught in inconsequential issues.\n\nHatred is a negative emotion and that is irrational and subjective.\u00a0 When hatred becomes all-pervasive in a society it can destroy a nation\u2019s spirit and could further hurt social capital and cooperation among citizens. This can be explained as to how the hatred of Hitler for Jews led to the corruption of many German citizens which had devastating effects on the German nation and its conscience. Therefore, hatred is indeed a serious threat to a person\u2019s wisdom, wellbeing, and national prosperity.",

      "explanation": "The societies across the globe are facing serious issues ranging from moral and cultural degradation to religious conflicts, corruption, lack of food and water security, lack of economic opportunity and employment, environmental degradations etc. It is in these times that the values like compassion, solidarity and peace become even more relevant.\n\n**Teachings of Buddha most relevant today:**\n\n* The Buddha stressed in his teachings that the way to extinguish desire, which causes suffering, is to liberate oneself from attachments like greed, desire, ignorance, delusion, hatred and destructive urges.\n* Buddha prescribed an eightfold path, the middle way for liberation. The eightfold path revolves around Wisdom (right understanding and intention), Ethical Conduct (right speech, action and livelihood) and Meditation (right effort, mindfulness and concentration).\n* Right action and livelihood can liberate society from corruption, it can ensure food and water security and will enhance economic opportunity and employment, giving way to prosperity for all.\n* Loving-kindness brings about positive attitudinal changes as it systematically develops the quality of \u2018loving-acceptance\u2019.\n* Right understanding and intention can open the path for knowledge and can liberate the people from ignorance and delusion.\n\nThe Buddhist teachings inculcate compassion, calmness & composure, joy among humans and they can help maintain a sustainable balance between man and nature.",

      "explanation": "Any society is governed by certain sets of laws and rules. Although in common language, these are synonyms yet there is substantial difference between them.\u00a0\n\n* **Laws:** These have the backing of legislative bodies. These are enforced by the government and every citizen has to obey them. A person can be punished for violation of laws. For example: Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, when enforced by the Parliament became a law.\n* **Rules:** These are the set of instructions which are concerned with do\u2019s and don\u2019ts. These are flexible in nature and these can be made by any organisation and people. Rules are broader in scope when compared to laws. For example: schools\u2019 instructions can be considered as rules.\n\n**Role of ethics in formulating Laws and Rules**\n\n* For effective governance of the country, laws are made by the parliamentarians. These laws should be guided by ethical standards which the society and nation opt for. Ethics and laws work simultaneously to ensure that citizens act in a certain manner and also make sure that these coordinate efforts protect the health, safety and welfare of the public.\n* Ethics is the guiding light that defines sound moral conduct and practices that ought to be followed by the individuals. This calls for framing of rules and regulations on the lines of ethics. For example, several institutions, business establishments etc. start their day by paying reverence to the almighty, a sort of ethical conduct. Several corporate houses, go beyond the legalised limit of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) and work for the disadvantaged sections of society just because their rules have a sound ethical backing.\n\nEthics helps in framing the code of conduct in a society which is essential to its functioning, for example: the Indian Constitution.",

If one cannot stretch the helping hand at the time of need, its better to stay away rather than interfering by means of wrong advice and acting under the influence of anger, jealousy or revenge to make the life worse.\n\nThe statement holds significance not only in day to day personal life but also in professional duties of, say, civil servants. A clerk at a pension sanctioning office can either help an old widowed lady get her rightful monthly pension or he can refuse her application for want of proper documents and worse off talk to her rudely and make her run from pillar to post for some forms and documents.\n\nThus, in the truest sense, the society can be more tolerant and flourishing if the actions of people are directed by humanity and acceptance.",

The Chairman of Bharat Missiles Ltd (BML) was watching a program on TV wherein the Prime Minister was addressing the nation on the necessity of developing a self-reliant India. He subconsciously nodded in agreement and smiled to himself as he mentally reviewed BML\u2019s journey in the past two decades. BML had admirably progressed from producing first generation anti-tank guided missiles (ATGMs) to designing and producing state of the art ATGM weapon systems that would be the envy of any army. He sighed in reconciliation with his assumptions that the government would probably not alter the status quo of a ban on exports of military weaponry.  To his surprise, the very next day he got a telephone call from the Director General, Ministry of Defence, asking him to discuss the modalities of increasing BML production of ATGMs as there is a possibility of exporting the same to a friendly foreign country. The Director General wanted the Chairman to discuss the details with his staff at Delhi next week.  Two days later, at a press conference, the Defence Minister stated that he aims to double the current weapons export levels within five years. This would give an impetus of financing the development and manufacture of indigenous weapons in the country. He also stated that all indigenous arms manufacturing nations have a very good record in international arms trade.  (a)\u00a0\u00a0 As Chairman of BML, what are your views on the following points?

      "explanation": "**Ethical Issues involved in arms trade:**\n\n* The primary use of weapons is to kill other humans. The earnings made from the arms trade are like blood money. Killing is inherently wrong and it is against humanity which is one of the central ideas of the Indian way of life.\n* India has been a land of Gautam Buddha and Mahatma Gandhi. They have advocated non-violence. But by indulging in arms trade, India will be endorsing violence, but in a different region of the world.\n* Article 51 of the Directive Principle of State Policy says that the government should aim for promotion of international peace and security.\n* By indulging in arms trade, India might be endorsing the actions and policies of foreign governments by which India may not stand. For example, selling weapons to autocratic countries and regimes known to suppress dissenting voices. In India, the government is accountable to parliament and weapons should be sold to democratic countries so that users can be held accountable.\n* While engaging in arms trade, India should ensure that arms exported are not being used to suppress dissent or subvert democracy or invasion of peaceful neighbours.\u00a0India should ensure use of exported weapons in self-defence and also not against India\u2019s own interest short term or long term.\n\n**Ethical factors that would influence the selling of arms to foreign governments are:**\n\n* **Responsible Nations**: The nations to which arms are being exported, should be a democratic and rational actor in international relations. There should be accountability for the actions of the government as governance is based on democratic ethics.\n* **Upholding Human Rights**: Some nations simply deny their people certain basic rights, while many actively harm those under their control for political or religious reasons. If the foreign government has a proven past record of human rights violation, then it is advisable that weapons either must not be sold or sold only after a strict scrutiny.\n* **Use of Weapons**: It should be preferred that weapons are being used in self-defence as defined under Article 51 of the United Nations Charter. Weapons must not be used for invasion of another nation or suppressing dissent or protests of people within the nation.\n* **Military Values**:\u00a0Indian Defense Forces have a long tradition of upholding human rights, respecting prisoners of wars, respect for international law in the battlefield. But if the military of a nation has a record of routinely taking civilians in the battlefield as prisoners, forcing young men to serve, even allowing children to be soldiers. Such factors must be considered.\n* **International Law**: While exporting critical technologies, it must be noted that the recipient nation is following the norms made by the\u00a0 International Export Groups such as Australia Group, Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) and the Wassenaar Arrangement.",

The ethical issues involved are:\n\n* **Livelihood vs Well-being**: The meagre livelihood opportunities have forced the local population to send their minor children to Bt-Cotton farms.\n* **Distress Migration**: Migration of youth in search of better working opportunities leaving their families behind in abysmal conditions.\n* **Child Labour**: Tribal people who are compelled to send their minor girls in the Bt-Cotton farms as their small landholdings are not earning well.\n* **Well-being of Minors**: Forced labour which is leading to the deterioration of health of minor girls.

Their products can be listed on websites like TribesIndia or marketplace like Hunar-Haat for sale.\n* As far as the return of migrants is concerned, it will require a calibrated approach.

The mishap resulted in a big hue and cry, forcing the government to institute an enquiry.**  **Your preliminary enquiry has revealed a series of anomalies.

    "solution": {
      "explanation": "The decision making of the civil servant is predominantly guided by the ethical principles in public interest and not by any kind of luring or fear by seniors or political veterans. In the given case, as a municipal commissioner, my role is to ensure that larger interests of the society are not the vested interests of few individuals. Any unethical decision by me favoring the builder or pleasing my senior or political veterans would not only be violating the code of conduct but are also against the basic values of impartiality, objectivity, and fairness.\n\n**Ethical issues involved in the given case:**\n\n* **Personal vs. Professional ethics**: Personal ethics involve morals and values that have been induced in me since my childhood, by parents, family and relatives and friends & teachers. Professional ethics on the other hand involve a strict adherence to code of conduct laid down at the workplace. Any violation of these rules and regulations can be termed as unprofessional. In this case, my personal ethics forces me to take personal interest in the case, conduct the enquiry at a fast pace and send the culprits behind the bars irrespective of consequences. But professional ethics suggest me to follow law and rules and involve my other teammates and seniors in the investigation process, or even quit from the enquiry if asked to do so by the authority concerned.\n* **Personal Interest vs. Public Interest**: The given situation may drive me as an officer to gain in terms of promotion or financial gains from higher authorities. This can be done if I keep my personal interest above public interest. Personal interest relates to ignoring the widespread nexus between officials of the Municipal Corporation and the builders and resolving the case at the earliest in the favour of the builder, while public interest lies in transparent and quick enquiry into the case and sending the culprits behind the bars thereby giving justice to victims and their families.\n* **Honesty & Courage vs. Flattering**: Honesty is a facet of moral character that connotes truthfulness and straightforwardness of conduct. Similarly, courage means the ability to control fear by ignoring consequences while critical decision making. Flattery, on the other hand, is done to seek attention or try to win favor for unethical reasons.\n\n**Options available with me are:**\n\n* The first option is to lose all my moral values and read the situation as an opportunity to take executive favour in terms of posting and promotion by seniors and politicians. This can be done if I totally ignore the nexus between officials of the Municipal Corporation and the builders and end up an enquiry with results in their favour.\n* The second option is to remain stuck to my moral principles of impartiality, integrity and probity thereby conducting a fair and transparent enquiry. If the builder and my senior officers are found guilty, a report regarding their conduct can be sent to the judicial and quasi-judicial authorities for further course of action.\n\n**My selected course of action:**\n\n* My moral principles drive me to adopt the second option as my final course of action. Being honest and courageous since childhood, I hardly have any fear of consequences. Also, if I find that there is too much political and administrative pressure on me to perform unethical action, then I may even breach the principle of hierarchy, and report the same to the higher central authorities and request them to tackle the situation. Also, I will bring the issue in public limelight through the media, which will continue the pressure of transparent enquiry on public officials on this matter.",

It has rocky terrain that is not suitable for agriculture, though some subsistence agriculture is being done on small plots of land. The area receives adequate rainfall and has an irrigation canal flowing through it. Amria, its administrative centre, is a medium sized town. It houses a large district hospital, an Industrial Training Institute and some privately owned skill training centres. It has all the facilities of a district headquarters. A trunk railway line passes approximately 50 kilometres from Amria. Its poor connectivity is a major reason for the absence of any major industry therein. The state government offers a 10 years tax holiday as an incentive to new industry.**  \n**In 2010 Anil, an industrialist, decided to take benefits to set up Amria Plastic Works (APW) in Noora village, about 20 km from Amria. While the factory was being built, Anil hired the required key labour and got them trained at the skill training centres at Amria. This act of his made the key personnel very loyal to APW.**  \n**APW started production in 2011 with the labour drawn fully from Noora village. The villagers were very happy to get employment near their homes and were motivated by the key personnel to meet the production targets with high quality. APW started making large profits, a sizable portion of which was used to improve the quality of life in Noora. By 2016, Noora could boast of a greener village and a renovated village temple. Anil liaised with the local MLA to increase the frequency of the bus services to Amria. The government also opened a primary health care centre and primary school at Noora in buildings constructed by APW. APW used its CSR funds to set up women\u2019s self-help groups, subsidize primary education to the village children and procure an ambulance for use by its employees and the needy.**  \n**In 2019, there was a minor fire in APW. It was quickly extinguished as fire safety protocols were in place in the factory. Investigations revealed that the factory had been using electricity in excess of its authorized capacity. This was soon rectified. The next year, due to a nationwide lockdown, the requirement of production fell for four months. Anil decided that all employees would be paid regularly. He employed them to plant trees and improve the village habitat. APW had developed a reputation of high-quality production and a motivated workforce.**  \n**Critically analyse the story of APW and state the ethical issues involved.

      "explanation": "Critical analysis of the story of APW:\n\n* Business activities, especially like setting up a small-scale manufacturing industry are done with the sole purpose of profit maximization and involve capital risk. Also, we know that proper and right choice of location is instrumental in future success of the industry. In our case, the condition of Parmal district, the Amria administrative centre within the district and the small Noora village is no more hidden after reading the given story. Despite such existing circumstances, the initiative to set up industry in such remote areas and ensure livelihood of villagers, that to with least government support, is a commendable and appreciable job. As far as excess use than granted capacity of electricity is concerned an enquiry can be initiated and prima facie a warning can be issued to administrative staff of the industry. Liaising with the local MLA to increase the frequency of the bus services to Amria can be considered a good initiative as it is the duty of the MLA to work in public interest and liaising is a part of long standing bureaucratic and corporate culture.\n\n**Ethical issues involved:**\n\n* **Selflessness vs. Business Ethics**: Selflessness is being more concerned about the needs and wishes of others than with one\u2019s own. Business ethics talks about profit maximization and rapid growth instead. In the given case, Anil despite being a businessman, was less concerned about business ethics and instead showed selfless character in decision making.\n* **Accountability vs. Transparency**: The case of accountability is worsened by the perceived lack of transparency in the system. Anil\u2019s industry should have maintained transparency in utilisation of allocated resources as running businesses brings accountability towards stakeholders.\n* **Spirit of Service and Sacrifice vs. Professionalism**: Spirit of Service and Sacrifice is the major quality required in public officials, while professionalism is the major quality required in a businessman or industrialist for boosting business growth. In the given case, Anil despite being a businessman showcased the quality of spirit of service and sacrifice & remained less professional in approach.\n\n**My take on APW\u2019s initiative:**\n\n* Yes, I consider APW as a role model for development of backward areas. Firstly, we all know profit maximization is the sole purpose of any kind of business by private individuals. But the same cannot be found true in case of Amria Plastic Works (APW) and its owner Anil. Despite low expectation of return, he decided to set up industry in the backward Noora village, tried to ensure livelihood for village people and give hope to villagers for prosperity reaching their doorsteps in near future. His works can be more related to multi-dimensional philanthropic agenda rather than pure business motive. Secondly, even during lockdown, when his profit from industry went to zero, in fact might be facing losses because of huge investment done earlier, Anil decided to pay all employees regularly and ensured food, nutrition and livelihood security for them. Thirdly, he employed villagemen to plant trees and improve the village habitat. This work in itself is a highly philanthrophic and altruistic activity as it does common good to mankind without any discrimination and irrational thinking. Finally, as far as works like using electricity in excess by his industry and liaising with the local MLA to increase the frequency of the bus services to Amria are concerned, they cannot be rated unethical, especially at the cost of what good he has done to the society. It is the duty of the government\u2019s executive authority to ensure smooth functioning of the system, if any small fault occurs, it can be dealt accordingly.",

      "question_text": "**12. Migrant workers have always remained at the socio-economic margins of our society, silently serving as the instrumental labour force of urban economics. The pandemic has brought them into national focus.**  \n**On announcement of a countrywide lockdown, a very large number of migrant workers decided to move back from their places of employment to their native villages. The non-availability of transport created its own problems. Added to this was the fear of starvation and inconvenience to their families. This caused the migrant workers to demand wages and transport facilities for returning to their villages. Their mental agony was accentuated by multiple factors such as a sudden loss of livelihood, possibility of lack of food and inability to assist in harvesting their rabi crop due to not being able to reach home in time. Reports of inadequate response of some districts in providing the essential boarding and lodging arrangements along the way multiplied their fears.**  \n**You have learnt many lessons from this situation when you were tasked to oversee the functioning of the District Disaster Relief Force in your district. In your opinion what ethical issues arose in the current migrant crisis? What do you understand by an ethical care giving state? What assistance can the civil society render to mitigate the sufferings of migrants in similar situations?**",

    "solution": {
      "explanation": "**Ethical issues that arose in the current migrant crisis:**\n\nWhile monitoring the District Disaster Relief Force, I witnessed certain ethical issues in fulfilling the responsibility of managing disasters.\n\n* **Conscience vs. administrative constraints**: While monitoring disaster management authority, I had limited resources to be spent. This posed the challenges of caring well for elderly migrants especially those suffering from any disease. Assisting elder family members with physical care, emotional support, managing crises, maintaining connections with others, tested the conscience & decision\u2013making of professionals.\n* **Selfish vs. selfless**: Selfish means lacking consideration for other people and preoccupation with one\u2019s own pleasure, profit or welfare, while selfless means having little or no concern for oneself, and helping society as a whole. Migrants in their barefoot long journeys witnessed both kinds of people in the society. While some helped the migrants on their way to home in a selfless approach, many others hardly showed any interest and took care of their family only.\n\n**Meaning of an ethical care giving state:**\n\n* The ethics of care giving involves helping the needy without expecting for any reward in return. \u2018Ethical care giving state\u2019 is a government or nation which ensures implementation of such policies that provide social, economic, and medical facilities for free to the needy. To provide the same, besides constructing necessary infrastructure, also needs both professionals and volunteers providing caregiving.\n\n**Assistance that the civil society can render to mitigate the sufferings of migrants in similar situations**\n\n* Civil society can construct temporary health centers, rehabilitation centers, avail doctors & nurses, and other care giving professionals, to take care of migrants in their way. Also, civil society can provide direct financial assistance to migrants, providing them with essentials such food & water and necessary medicines, arranging transportation facilities to their destination. Civil societies and many individuals took responsibility and were highly successful in helping migrants during the COVID-19 pandemic in India.",

    "solution": {
      "explanation": "The Constitution of India provides for a parliamentary form of government, where the Executive is responsible to the Parliament for its policies and acts. The parliamentary democracy provides for a daily assessment of accountability of the executive to the legislature.\n\n**The Parliament ensures the accountability of the Executive in the following ways:**\n\n* Question-hour, zero hour, calling attention motion, adjournment motion, no-confidence motion, censure motion, and other discussions.\n* MPs may pose questions to ministers related to the implementation of laws and policies by the government.\n* Budgetary control for appropriation of grants and post-budgetary control through committees like Public Accounts Committees.\n* The system of committees \u2013 such as standing committees, select committees and ad hoc committees etc. \u2013 facilitate scrutiny of the actions and activities of the executive.\n\nNevertheless, there have been some recent instances wherein the Parliament was found to be unable to ensure accountability of the executive:\n\n* Evading route of debates/discussions/checks, such in the cases of Aadhaar Act (money bill route), farm laws (use of voice vote mechanism), etc.\n* The Parliament side-lined the parliamentary institutions as lesser bills were referred to parliamentary committees.\n* Due to lack in coordination and decorum, there were disruptions during the sessions and question hour registered low productivity.\n\nThus, though the Parliament seems to be quite empowered to hold the political executive to account, there are several limitations and constrains over this power in practice. Some such constraints may be enumerated as follows:\n\n* Dominance of the majority party or majority coalition in the parliament.\n* The compulsions of anti-defection law and the role of party whips.\n* Complex and technically complicated presentation of policies, laws and the budgets.\n* Frequent use of exceptional provisions of the Constitution like ordinance making power.\n\nTo ensure complete accountability of the Executive to the Parliament, some steps need to be taken. One can accommodate the 15-point reform charter as suggested by the Vice President. It is also required to make the committee system function effectively and efficaciously by ensuring that the members of the committee are nominated on the basis of domain knowledge and for a longer assured term.",

      "explanation": "A pressure group is a group of people who are organised actively for promoting and defending their common interest. They are different from the political parties. Their activities are confined to the protection and promotion of the interests of their members by influencing the government.\n\nThe pressure groups influence the policymaking and policy implementation in the government through methods like lobbying, correspondence, publicity, propagandising, petitioning, public debating, and so forth.\n\nA business association refers to membership organisations that are engaged in and supportive of the promotion of the business interests of their members. Since businesses are strongly affected by public policies, it is in their best interest to stay informed about public policies and to try to influence governmental decision making and public policy.\n\nIn India, examples of business association include Federation of Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industry (FICCI), Associated Chamber of Commerce and Industry of India (ASSOCHAM), Federation of All India Food Grain Dealers Association (FAIFDA), etc.\n\n**Contribution of business associations to public policies:**\n\n* They engage with the policy makers and communicate the grievances of the industries to the government. They, thus, influence the policies by way of articulating the views and suggestions of the industry.\n* They provide a potent platform for consensus-building on key issues. In this regard, they often conduct workshops, seminars and business meets to discuss various policies.\n* The business associations provide useful and credible research on existing and newer developments in areas\u00a0such as industrial operations, infrastructure and technology. Likewise, they provide valuable information on new developments in foreign trade. All these go a long way in influencing the public policies.\n\nBesides, in a system of representative democracy, the business groups influence the political process through several ways such as funding election expenses of the parties, mobilising the support of the voters, etc. The more organised the group is, the more influential it is in the political process, and so in public policymaking.",

    "solution": {
      "explanation": "Water is a scarce natural resource but the major requirement in the agricultural sector. The efficient use of available water for irrigation is a major challenge. A nation with annual water availability of below 1,700 kilolitres per head is considered water deficient. India\u2019s per capita water availability is estimated at 1,428 kilolitres per year.\n\nMicro-irrigation is a modern method of irrigation by which water is irrigated through drippers, sprinklers, foggers and by other emitters on the surface or subsurface of the land. Sprinkler irrigation and drip irrigation are the commonly used micro-irrigation methods.\n\n**Significance of micro-irrigation:**\n\n* Micro-irrigation ensures water use efficiency. It applies water directly to the root zone, the practice reduces loss of water through conveyance, run-off, deep percolation and evaporation.\n* Water savings in comparison with flood irrigation are to the tune of 30-50%.\n* Electricity consumption falls significantly, as being water efficient it requires less water to be pumped.\n* The localised water application in micro-irrigation prevents fertilizers from washing away, and so reduces nutrient loss or leaching. The micro-irrigation system can also be effectively used to apply fertilizers (fertigation) in a targeted way so as to prevent weed growth.\n* Micro-irrigation, by virtue of localised water application, avoids soil erosion. It does not require land leveling and can irrigate fields that are irregularly shaped, making it much less labor-intensive and less costly.\n\n**Nevertheless, micro-irrigation also has certain limitations:**\n\n* Expense especially initial cost is high mainly for marginal and small farmers.\n* Maintenance cost for the tubes, sprinklers may go out of pocket for small farmers.\n* The lifetime of the tubes used in drip irrigation can be shortened by the sun causing wastage.\n* It needs more awareness and higher rate of adoption in water stressed areas.\n\nThe future revolution in agriculture will come from precision farming. Micro-irrigation can, indeed, be the stepping stone for achieving the goal of making farming sustainable, profitable and productive.",

    "solution": {
      "explanation": "V-shaped recovery is characterised by a quick and sustained recovery in measures of economic performance after a sharp economic decline. It is very apt to state that the Indian economy has recently experienced V-shaped recovery.\n\n**Supportive arguments:**\n\n* **Quarterly GDP Growth:** The COVID-19 pandemic has been a human and economic catastrophe for India. Almost one-fourth of the country\u2019s economic activity was wiped out due to fall in domestic demand in wake of the strict nationwide lockdowns. India\u2019s GDP dipped a historic 23.9% in the first quarter (Q1) of 2020. The contraction narrowed down to 7.5% in the second quarter (Q2).\n* **Rise in Government Expenditure**: Total expenditure of the government rose 48.3% on year-on-year basis in the month of November. On the other hand, capital expenditure shrugged off a three-month contraction and expanded 248.5%. This was mainly due to the introduction of the Atmanirbhar Bharat package.\n* **Revival of Imports/Exports**: After dipping for 9 consecutive months, merchandise imports finally experienced a growth of 7.6% (y-o-y) in December 2020. The revival was led by gold, electronic goods and vegetable oils. India\u2019s merchandise exports have reached pre-COVID-19 levels and exhibited a growth of 0.1% in December 2020.\n* **Financial Markets Surge**: The COVID-19 pandemic kept the Sensex to a record low in late March 2020. However, it staged a strong recovery from the lows. Both the BSE and NSE indices finally wrapped up 2020 on a bullish note.\n* **IPO Market**: During December 2020, the listings of two Initial Public Offerings (IPOs), aggregating Rs. 1,351 crore, took the total resource mobilisation through main board IPOs to Rs. 15,971 crore during 2020-21 (up to December 2020), marking a sharp rebound from Rs. 10,487 crore in the corresponding period of the previous year.\n* **Industrial Activity**: Although industrial output remains volatile, contracting by 1.9% in November 2020 after a record expansion in October by 4.2%, industrial activity is finally turning around. The headline Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index (PMI) manufacturing expanded in December 2020 to 56.4, a tick higher than November\u2019s reading of 56.3.\n* **Record GST Collections**: The gross Goods and Services Tax collections touched a record high of over Rs. 1.15 lakh crore in December - the highest since the implementation of the regime. The collection indicates that the economy continues to show signs of recovery after a stringent lockdown.",

Biotechnology generates cellular and biomolecular processes to develop technologies and products that help improve our lives and the health of our planet. Biotechnology is helping to heal the world by harnessing nature\u2019s own toolbox and using our own genetic makeup.\n\n**Research and developmental achievements:**\n\n* **Stem Cell Research:** Stem cells have the ability to keep on dividing infinitely and have the capacity to distinguish into different types of body cells during the early development of an organism. Researchers can program these stem cells to differentiate into specific types of cells.\n* **Human Genome Project:** It was an international scientific research project coordinated by the National Institutes of Health and the U.S. Department of Energy. Officially launched in 1990, it had the goal of determining the sequence of nucleotide base pairs that make up human DNA. It has supported researchers in identifying genes that cause diseases.\n* **Targeted Cancer Therapies:** The established standard chemotherapies are toxic for healthy cells at present. Targeted cancer therapies are drugs that operate either by interfering with the function of specific molecules or by only targeting known cancerous cells in order to reduce damage to healthy cells.\n* **CRISPR:** Clustered Regularly Interspersed Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) is a relatively new gene-editing system that has been hailed as a groundbreaking tool in medical research. HIV research is one of its many uses.\n\n**Role in uplifting poorer sections of society:**\n\n* Biotechnology is assisting to expand the income of marginal farmers by increasing crop yield and making it climate and pest resilient.\n* It has revolutionised the medical science leading to controlled death rate and world class treatment possible in India itself.\n* By genome sequencing, biotechnology helps in accessing health of the people from the corners of India which ultimately proves conducive for the government in framing targeted policy initiatives.\n* It also proves beneficial in expanding the shelf life of food products, which in turn, keeps their price in check for the poor.\n* Pollution attacks poor the most. Biotechnology helps in reducing pollution and, thus, alleviates their suffering. For example, landfills are cleaned through bioremediation techniques.",

      "explanation": "LEDs are basically semiconductors that have been built so they emit light when they are activated. White light, which we generally use, is made by a combination of red, green and blue light. Scientists say that while it was easier to make red and green LEDs, making Blue LED was the ultimate challenge. The Nobel Prize in Physics 2014 was awarded jointly to Isamu Akasaki, Hiroshi Amano and Shuji Nakamura for the invention of efficient blue light-emitting diodes which has enabled bright and energy-saving white light sources.\n\n**Impact of this invention on our everyday life:**\n\n* **Electricity Conservation:** A modern white LED light bulb converts more than 50% of the electricity it uses into light. This is opposed to the 4% conversion rate for incandescent bulbs.\n* **Increasing Access to Electricity:** White LEDs\u2019 efficiency makes them appealing for getting lighting to folks living in regions without electricity supply. A solar installation can charge an LED lamp to last a long time.\n* **Smart Energy Efficient Homes:** In addition to generating light, LEDs can incorporate sensors that detect when people are in a room, and switch off the lights when no one is there \u2013 a requirement for any smart home.\n* **Enables other Technological Advancements:** In the electronics industry, LEDs provide backlighting for the liquid crystal displays (LCDs) in many smartphones, laptops and televisions. The LEDs are more energy-efficient than the fluorescent lights that are sometimes used for backlighting, and allow for very thin displays.\n* **Increased Ability to Store Data:** Blu-ray players, the successor to DVD players, use blue LED lasers to read data off a digital optical disc. When these systems switched from using an infrared laser (like that used in DVD players) to a blue LED laser, it became possible to store five to 10 times as much data.\n\nResearchers are exploring other applications of LEDs as well like in transmitting data from the Internet and water purification. These advancements show that LEDs will continue to impact everyday life of humans for years to come.",

Ethics relates primarily to the nature of ultimate values and standards by which human actions can be judged. Ethics are subjective standard of rights and wrong.\n\nFor a civil servant, acting ethically is of utmost importance.

      "explanation": "A decision maker is characterised by two binary relations. The first reflects decisions that are rational in an \u201cobjective\u201d sense: the decision maker can convince others that she is right in making them. The second relation models decisions that are rational in a \u201csubjective\u201d sense: the decision maker cannot be convinced that she is wrong in making them. Objectivity or rationality in decision making depends upon availability, quantity and quality of data.\n\nDigital technology has almost become ubiquitous in all phases of the decision-making process. At the data collection stage, people use technology to access information, and this information influences the decision maker in the following decision steps. Technology helps people filter, analyse, and process information as well as formulate alternatives and evaluate them, whether consciously or unconsciously.\n\n**Digital technologies can act as a reliable source of input for rational decision, as:**\n\n* Big data analysis can predict future progression of an event like climate change, COVID-19 outbreak etc., which helps in rational decisions and course corrections.\n* It enables data sharing and monitoring in real time, helping in identifying bottlenecks and undertaking necessary reforms.\n* Digital technologies have also made it easier to collect and collate data and convert it using various algorithms, which can help in surveys like census, NFHS etc.\n* It also helps in integrating data and information spread across different departments, ministries and geographies, which provides a holistic picture.\n* Through correct measures and ways, it can act as a reliable source to spread information and make people aware.\n\nAs a coin has two sides, every situation too has its pros and cons too. Digital technologies can be a reliable source, but at times, this perception changes. It can be concluded so by:\n\n* Digital technologies are devoid of human emotions and decisions based on such information can violate basic principles of compassion and fairness.\n* Digital technologies have resulted in targeted messages changing the attitude of recipients and manipulating them, as seen during elections.\n* Digital technology impacts decisions and leads to bounded rationality.\n* During the COVID-19 pandemic, digital media was the hub of unverified information creating confusions and cognitive dissonance.\n\nThus, digital technology provides information but objectivity of decisions is also based on human values, attitudes and conscience.",

      "explanation": "Perseverance is the ability to sustain one\u2019s efforts in face of immense difficulties. Perseverance is the key to success. Integrity in adulthood is built on years of value inculcation and winning over temptations of dishonesty.  \nGautam Buddha faced several austerities in his life, and through his intellectual queries and debates, he later achieved enlightenment. Swami Vivekananda was an inquisitive man. His open and inquisitive mind led him to his Guru Shree Ramkrishna Paramhans. Through his Guru, he found his mission in life. Mahatma Gandhi, in his book, \u2018My Experiments with Truth\u2019 highlighted how he was indulged in lying and stealing at a young change. But, during the freedom struggle, his approach evolved in contrasting ways.  \nVijay Vardhan who secured 104th rank in UPSC Civil Services Exam in 2018 had failed more than 35 exams before hitting the bull\u2019s eye. The list of failures may crack any person and force them to give up on their dreams. But Vijay epitomised the adage, \u201cWhat does not break you, makes you stronger.\u201d He continued to strive for his dreams and his perseverance paid off.  \nDifficulties, trial and tribulations, and failure are part of the way to success.

      "explanation": "Attitude is generally defined as the way a person responds to his or her environment, either positively or negatively. Work environment can affect a person\u2019s attitude. An attitude is a relatively stable predisposition. It goes a long way in shaping the development of a human being.\n\nAttitudes provide meaning (knowledge) for life. The knowledge function refers to our need for a world which is consistent and relatively stable. This allows us to predict what is likely to happen, and so gives us a sense of control. Attitudes can help us organise and structure our experience.\n\nPublic servants are the representatives of the government. A positive attitude is considered to be an indispensable characteristic of a public servant. Ways to build suitable attitude for a public servant:\n\n* **Organisation and Negotiating Skills:** In any role in the public sector, one will be required to juggle different projects with varying degrees of priority along with multiple stakeholders and personalities. A person may need to influence others as part of his/her role or negotiate with other departments.\n* **Creativity and Flexible Thinking:** The ability to adapt to change and think creatively around problems is a necessity in this field.\n* **Leadership:** In both the civil service and public affairs, one would be keen to learn how to become a great leader - influencing and inspiring those to act around him/her.\n* **Decision-Making Ability:** One would be required to make tough decisions under pressure. He/she would be someone who won\u2019t shy away from coming up with solutions, however, difficult.\n* **Teamworking Skills:** One would be working with a myriad of different people with varying skills and qualities. He/she would need to know how to motivate them and work alongside them.\n* **Ability to Work Alone:** Part of one\u2019s work will require independent thought and the ability to come up with solutions on his/her own. He/she would be someone who can remain focused during these times.",

      "explanation": "Social Audit is the audit of a scheme jointly by the Government and the people. A social audit helps to narrow gaps between vision/goal and reality, between efficiency and effectiveness. MGNREGA was the first Act to mandate a Social Audit by the Gram Sabha.\n\nSocial Audit informs and educates people about their rights and entitlements. It provides a collective platform for people to ask queries, express their needs and grievances (jansunwai). It promotes people\u2019s participation in all stages of implementation of programmes. People\u2019s involvement makes things credible and inclusive and as a result the ethical conduct of the schemes/authorities/organisations also increase. It also brings about transparency and objectivity in government schemes and authorities become accountable to the public at large.\n\n**In judiciary also Social Audit plays an important role:**\n\n* Social auditing uses participatory techniques to involve all stakeholders in measuring, understanding, reporting and improving the social performance of an organisation. This way people will understand and become aware about the judicial structure and proceedings. This will also help in making judiciary more interactive and understandable to common people, thereby improving its performance and accountability.\n* Social Audit can help make judiciary reach the masses and spread awareness about it. It can help judiciary proactively take up cases of disadvantaged/vulnerable/marginalised sections of society which need help and attention.\n\nEven though social audit has been of great importance, it still needs awareness to increase its reach among the masses. Administrative and political cooperation is required for the better functioning of SA. A legal backing or a national law should also be considered.",

Considering his profile, he was picked up by his bosses to handle a very challenging and sensitive assignment. He was posted in a tribal dominated district notorious for illegal sand mining. Excavating sand from river belt and transporting through trucks and selling them in black market was rampant. This illegal sand mining mafia was operating with the support of local functionaries and tribal musclemen who in turn were bribing selected poor tribals and had kept the tribals under fear and intimidation.  \nSunil being a sharp and energetic officer immediately grasped the ground realities and the modus operandi followed by the mafia through their devious and dubious mechanism. On making inquiries, he gathered that some of their own office employees are in hand and glove with them and have developed close unholy nexus. Sunil initiated stringent action against them and started conducting raids on their illegal operations of movement of trucks filled with sand. The mafia got rattled as not many officers in the past had taken such strong steps against the mafia. Some of the office employees who were allegedly close to mafia informed them that the officer is determined to clean up the mafia\u2019s illegal sand mining operations in that district and may cause them irreparable damage.  \nThe mafia turned hostile and launched counter-offensive. The tribal musclemen and mafia started threatening him with dire consequences. His family (wife and old mother) were stalked and were under virtual surveillance and thus causing mental torture, agony and stress to all of them. The matter assumed serious proportions when a muscleman came to his office and threatened him to stop raids, etc., otherwise, his fate will not be different than some of his predecessors (ten years back one officer was killed by the mafia).  \n(a)\u2002Identify the different options available to Sunil in attending to this situation.  \n(b)\u2002Critically evaluate each of the options listed by you.  \n(c)\u2002Which of the above, do you think, would be the most appropriate for Sunil to adopt and why?",

As a part of general inquiry, Pawan gathered that his senior officer carries the reputation of being difficult and insensitive person having his own disturbed family life. Initially, all seemed to go well. However, after some time Pawan felt that the senior officer was belittling him and at times unreasonable. Whatever suggestions given or views expressed by Pawan in the meetings were summarily rejected and the senior officer would express displeasure in the presence of others.

It became apparent that though there were no serious work-related problems/shortcomings, the senior officer was always on one pretext or the other and would scold and shout at him. The continuous harassment and public criticism of Pawan resulted in loss of confidence, self-esteem and equanimity. Pawan realised that his relation with his senior officer was becoming more toxic and due to this, he felt perpetually tensed, anxious and stressed. His mind was occupied with negativity and caused him mental torture, anguish and agony. Eventually, it badly affected his personal and family life. He was no longer joyous, happy and contented even at home. Rather without any reason he would lose his temper with his wife and other family members.

His personal responsibilities would also suffer.\n\n**(b) Approach Pawan should adopt**\n\n* **At office:**\n\n* He should introspect\u00a0his behaviour, as to whether his actions are annoying his senior and what is the\u00a0behaviour\u00a0of his senior towards other newly transferred colleagues. This will give him a thought clarity.\n* Pawan should try talking to his seniors (boss\u2019 colleagues) and explain his actions and at the same time understand his boss\u2019 temperament. This will give opportunity for course correction to Pawan and his senior.\n* If both the above suggestions do not work out, then Pawan should lodge a written complaint to his boss\u2019 senior and make the superior boss aware of all the happenings.\n\n* **At home:**\n\n* Pawan should try segregating his professional and personal life. He should evolve his emotional intelligence quotient.\n* He should talk to his family members, wife about the issues he is facing at the workplace. The family members should try to understand and support him through his difficulties. This will bring peace, tranquility, and a congenial environment both at his office and at home.\n\n**(c) As an outsider, my suggestion**\n\n* **To boss:**\n\n* One should act and behave as a leader and represent himself/herself as an example. Developing emotional intelligence in this aspect is very necessary.\n* Subordinates are the working force behind every organisation. As an authority/senior, one must respect the subordinates or the juniors.\n* Constructive criticism goes a long way in shaping an organisation or one\u2019s life. Belittling someone to show oneself as superior always gives out a bad example.\n* Appreciating good work is not only ethically warranted but also creates positive energy amongst team members.\n* **To subordinates:**\n* Do not let the professional and personal life merge. Work related issues should not hamper the personal space and vice-versa.\n* Nothing comes above self-respect. Constructive criticism is welcomed, but not demeaning. When at workplace, one should work with utmost dedication and commitment.\n\n**(d) Following types of training\u00a0can be given to the officers in government offices:**\n\n* **Sensitivity Training:**\u00a0Officials should be sensitised about how their actions impact people around them.\u00a0Mental health issues should be kept in mind.\n* **Role-playing Training:**\u00a0To be a people\u2019s officer or a successful bureaucrat, one must investigate the situation from other\u2019s perspective and understand their problems and constraints.\u00a0This will always provide a constructive decision in decision making.\n* **Assertiveness Training:** Officials should exercise authority without being condescending to others.\u00a0They should build team spirit and foster cooperation.\n* **Communication Training:**\u00a0Using\u00a0verbal and non-verbal cues\u00a0for effective communication.\u00a0The motive of this is to increase positivity in outlook, promote inclusiveness and make work culture conducive for performance.",

      "explanation": "* A strait is a narrow oceanic waterbody connecting two seas or two other large water bodies. It acts as a passage or gallery for ships in the water between water bodies. E.g., Malacca strait, Gibraltar strait, etc.\n* An isthmus is a narrow strip of land that connects two larger landmasses and separates two bodies of water. E.g., Isthmus of Suez, connecting Africa and Asia.\n\n#### **Significance of Staits and Isthmus in international trade:**\n\n* They reduce distance between the places and facilitate greater trade. E.g., the Suez Canal on the isthmus of Suez prevents the circumvent of the Africa by ships for trade between Asia and Europe.\n* The straits and isthmus also provide good harbor and ports leading to international trade facilitation. E.g., Singapore port on the Malacca strait.\n* It also provides connectivity between lager landmass and the water bodies. Like Panam\u00e1 Canal on isthmus of Panama connects Atlantic and Pacific oceans.\n* It also revolutionizes the shipping industry by facilitating efficient transportation.\n* It provides the bridge between the demand and supply of the commodity. E.g., Japan buys the iron ore of India through the strait of Malacca.\n* It provides environmentally friendly shipping. E.g., By making the Palk Strait deeper, Indian ships could circumvent Sri Lanka (a long route) while transporting goods from Vizag to Kochin (saving fuel).\n* It facilitates the export and import of international trade in tourism services by providing recreational services along the coasts of the isthmus and straits.\n* It provides good ground for fishing and aquaculture and thus, promotes international trade in marine products.\n* It also provides the strategic place for defence establishment that facilitates international trade by providing security from pirates.",

      "explanation": "In western nations, negative form of secularism is followed which means state is separate from religion and has nothing to do with religion of the people but in India, positive form of secularism is followed which means the state gives equal respect to all religions. Citizens can publicly wear their religious signs and symbols. There is no official religion of India.\n\nSecularism is an essential feature of Indian Constitution. This feature reflects the secular values of Indian society from ancient past. Tolerance, assimilation and pluralism are the key elements in the making of an Indian form of secularism.\n\n#### **Tolerance as the key element of Indian form of Secularism:**\n\nIt means people of different religions; sects have respect and tolerance for each other's religion.\n\n* India is where Buddhism and Jainism first appeared. These religions propagated a message of peace and tolerance.\n* The founder of the Sikh religion, Shri Guru Nanak Dev Ji, preached about international brotherhood (tolerance).\n* Almost no native King forced his subjects to convert to another religion, with a few exceptions.\n* The religious tolerance policies of Mughal King Akbar and Buddhist King Ashoka are particularly well-known.\n* 'Vasudhaiva Kutumbaka' is a phrase in Maha Upanishad, a Hindu religious text which essentially means \"the world is family\".\n* The fundamental rights guaranteed by the state's constitution (Articles 25 to 28), which guarantee that everyone of its inhabitants has the right to practice any religion, represent the state's tolerance of all religions. The state doesn't have a recognized religion.\n\n#### **Assimilation as the key element of Indian form of Secularism:**\n\nAssimilation is the process whereby individuals or groups of differing ethnic heritage are absorbed into the dominant culture of a society.\n\n* People from all major religions coexist peacefully in India. India was the birthplace of Buddhism, Jainism, and Sikhism. Along with invaders from Persia and Afghanistan, Islam arrived in India. What's fascinating, though, is that new religions that developed here were introduced by invaders, yet they coexisted with the rest of society at the time without losing their distinctive identities.\n* When multiple religious communities coexist, over time they begin to incorporate elements of one another's art, architecture, culture, and religion. For instance, Mughal period produced a distinctive Mughal style as a result of the fusion of Persian Islamic architecture and native Indian design. The Mughal era strongly influenced the Rajput paintings of Jaipur and Amber.\n\n#### **Pluralism as the key element of Indian form of Secularism:**\n\nIt means people of different religion, sects, cultures live together with harmony.\n\n* Since ancient times, people of various sects and religions have lived in India. All of the world's main religions are represented in India. These include Islam, Hinduism, Christianity, Buddhism, Zoroastrianism, Judaism, Sikhism, and Buddhism.\n* Each religion also has a number of subgroups. For instance, there are followers of Shaivism and Vaishnavism in Hinduism, and Sunni and Shia Muslims. Here, there are residents of various faiths and religions.\n* Around India, Buddhism first appeared in the sixth century BC. In India, Jainism grew mostly after the sixth century BC. After the 10th century AD, India was where Islam flourished most quickly. Sikhism was started by Guru Nanak Dev Ji in the 15th century. In the eighth century AD, Zoroastrianism arrived in India. Therefore, pluralism has always been a part of India.\n* With a few exceptions, the governing rulers did not meddle in peoples' religious practices. Instead, they offered them financial support and land for religious purposes. Secularism has therefore been a part of Indian society and culture for many years.",

      "explanation": "* **Globalization** means growing interdependence and integration of world economies, societies and cultures brought about by cross border trade of goods, services and technology and flow of investment and people.\n* In the human world 'resource' is anything that can be used to fulfill our needs and wants. Often some resources are abundant in some nations and scarce in other nations. Mutual needs lead to cooperation between them.\n* The relations between globalization and new technology in the world of scarce resources have varied facets with its pros and cons.\n\n**The positives of the relation between globalization and new technology, in context of scarce resources are:**\n\n* **Natural Resources:** Globalization brings cooperation for efficient use of the resource. Like:\n  + Energy: India\u2019s global initiative i.e., International Solar Alliance (ISA) to tackle the scarcity of fossil fuel by securing solar energy.\n  + Infrastructure: Diven by technical knowledge and sustainable spirit, the organization like Coalition for Disaster Resilient infrastructure (CDRI) initiated by India for global contribution.\n* **Defence:** Indian engagement with global players and partners like Israel (Barak Missile), Philippines (Brahmos Missile), Russia (AK-203) to manage the security challenge.\n* **Space cooperation:** India\u2019s global cooperation with countries like Russia and France (Gaganyaan), US (NISAR Satellites) for best utilization of expensive resources.\n* **Transport and Communication:** Cooperation with global countries like Japan (Bullet train), EU (5G), etc.\n\n**Apart from the positive, there are negatives as well. Like:**\n\n* **Brain Drain:** Indian trained youth choose developed countries and devoid India for further development.\n* **Neo-tech-colonization** by the large tech giant on the name of data privacy, freedom of speech etc.\n* Diversion of scarce resources for technology adaptation (Bullet train) and thus **curtailing the expenditure on humanitarian development.**\n* Global relations promote the import of cutting-edge technologies. This decreases the forex on one hand and the technological research on the other hand. E.g., Not a single successful Indian handset in Indian market.\n* The monopoly and scarcity of strategic technologies compromised the security of Indians like Red Echo attack on Power supply in Mumbai by Chinese equipment.\n\nIn view of the advantages and disadvantages of India\u2019s relation with global world in an era of scarce resources, we have to be Atmanirbhar with suita ble and strategic global support to increase our capabilities.",

Under the Article 40 of the Indian Constitution, the States shall take steps to organise Village Panchayats and endow them powers and authority to function as unit of self-government.\n\n**Achievement of Decentralisation of Power**\n\n* **Decision-making:** The local people can participate in decision-making at local-level issues.\n* **Women representation:** 33% reservation for women has helped to increase women\u2019s voice and representation in our democracy.\n* **Swachh Bharat Abhiyan:** In 2019, India became open-defecation free because of ground level work by local bodies.\n* **Literacy campaign:** Arati Devi, sarpanch in a village in Ganjam district in Odisha is credited with starting a literacy campaign for women and reviving traditional folk art in Ganjam.\n* **Self-help Groups:** Meena Behen, sarpanch from a village in Gujarat, has worked for inculcating leadership skills to the self-help group (SHG).\n\n#### **Some Issues Which Halt the Decentralisation of Power in Letter and Spirit**\n\n* **Inadequate Finances:** Limited power to impose cesses and taxes.\n* **Unscientific Distribution of Functions:** Panchayat and the Panchayat Samiti functions overlap, leading to confusion, duplication of efforts.\n* **Lack of Coordination:** Government officials do not coordinate with local representatives.\n* **No real Functions:** Functions like education, health, sanitation and water are remain concentrated with State Governments.\n\nFor Local bodies and Panchayats to play a bigger role in human capital interventions, there is need for adequate fiscal resources along with functions and functionaries.

On the other hand, the President of India is elected by the elected members of Parliament and State Legislative Assemblies.\n* The nomination of President of India requires 50 electors as proposers and 50 electors as seconders, whereas President of France requires 500 elected officials as proposers.\n* The French presidential election is split up into two rounds. In the first round, people can vote for any of the candidates that have gathered the 500 signatures. If no candidate receives an absolute majority, then in second round candidate can vote for only remaining candidate who emerged first and second in first and second round.\n* There is no procedure of security deposits in French Presidential elections unlike Indian Presidential election.\n\nThus, we can say that there are some similarities as well as dissimilarities in election procedure of Presidents India and France.

      "explanation": "The Election Commission of India (ECI) is an autonomous constitutional body responsible for administering Union and State election processes in India. In the context of free and fair elections, Model Code of Conduct (MCC) plays a crucial role.\n\nThe Model Code of Conduct is a set of guidelines issued by the Election Commission to regulate political parties and candidates prior to elections. MCC is operational from the date on which the election schedule is announced until the date of result announcement.\n\n#### **Evolution of Model Code of Conduct**\n\n* The origins of the Model Code of Conduct lie in the Assembly elections of Kerala in 1960, when the State administration prepared a \u2018Code of Conduct\u2019 for political factors.\n* In the Lok Sabha elections of 1962, the Election Commission of India circulated the code to all recognized political parties and State Governments, and it was followed.\n* In 1991, the Election Commission decided to enforce the Model Code of Conduct more strictly because of repeated flouting of the election norms and continued corruption.\n\n**Role of ECI in the Enforcement of MCC**\n\n* As part of its mandate to conduct free and fair elections under Article 324 of the Constitution, the Election Commission ensures that ruling parties at the Centre and in States adhere to the code.\n* In case of electoral offences, malpractices, and corrupt practices like inducements to voters, bribery, intimidation or any undue influence, the Election Commission acts against violators.\n* The Election Commission has devised several mechanisms for efficient enforcement of MCC such as:   \n  + Joint task forces of enforcement agencies and flying squads.\n  + Introduction of the c-VIGIL mobile app through which audio-visual evidence of malpractices can be reported.\n\nModel Code of Conduct does not have any statutory backing, it has come to acquire strength in the past decade because of its strict enforcement by the Election Commission. The various technological advancement has presented new challenges in the path of ensuring fair elections, but initiatives took by the Election Commission regarding the enforcement of model code of conduct seem to have been fruitful.",

    "solution": {
      "explanation": "Donor agencies are the agencies which provide financial help in the developmental process. It may be a national or international agency, like Japan International Cooperation, World Bank, Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation etc. In recent times, development processes have been getting dependent on donor agencies for the obvious reason to have easy access to funds.\n\nHowever, this increasing dependence devoid of community participation is fraught with risks. In simple terms, community participation means involving the grassroot level stakeholders in the developmental process.\n\nIn this respect, the following points can be noted that pertain to the working of donor agencies:\n\n* Given the strong financial backing of donor agencies there is less hindrance in the development process. However, they have less accountability in the whole process because they are very objective in nature rather than participatory.\n* In the developmental process, donor agencies can have their own rules related to labour wages and their working conditions. This often reduces community participation to the extent that it even alienates the same communities for which it is vouched.\n* They are more technology-oriented and productivity-focussed. This often causes a decrease in labour force participation. Additionally, donor agencies can also promote favoritism, this means that they help as per their choice not as per need. This can lead to regionally skewed development.\n\nThus, to ensure effective development process, community participation is a must to illustrate, consider the tribal areas. The best way to ensure its development is to involve the tribals by means of manpower contribution, social audit, allowing them to promote their language & culture, promotion of cooperative culture, etc.\n\nIf one gets dependent only on donor agencies then it is like a top-down approach to the development process which can often be away from the ground realities.\n\nThus, Donor agencies are humanitarian but if we get over-dependent on them, then they will ignore domestic or local needs and, in some way, it is like colonialism and this will affect community participation. So, a balanced approach is more suitable in any developmental process between donor agencies and communities.",

      "explanation": "The Public distribution system (PDS) is an Indian food security system established under the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food, and Public Distribution. PDS is operated under the joint responsibility of the central and the state governments.\n\nThere are many issues associated with PDS system in India:\n\n* Studies show that entitled beneficiaries are not getting food grains while those that are ineligible are getting undue benefits.\n* TPDS (Targeted PDS) suffers from large leakages of food grains during transportation.\n* Open-ended Procurement i.e., all incoming grains accepted even if buffer stock is filled, creates a shortage in the open market.\n* A performance audit by the CAG has revealed a serious shortfall in the government\u2019s storage capacity.\n\nHowever, various measures can be taken to make it effective and transparent:\n\n* Its effectiveness can be enhanced with technology-based solutions. Shifting towards DBT is another idea, but with caution.\n* Increased public participation through social audits and participation of SHGs, Cooperatives and NGOs will ensure the transparency of the PDS system at the ground level.\n* Integrating Aadhar with TPDS will help in the better identification of beneficiaries and address the problem of inclusion and exclusion errors. This will make PDS more effective.\n\nPDS is one of the biggest welfare programmes of the government. Strengthening of the existing TPDS system by capacity building and training of the implementing authorities along with efforts to plug leakages is the best way forward.",

In any particular situation, a person\u2019s decision is based on his experience and knowledge to overlook or reckon with something.\n\nHowever, a bureaucrat engrossed with the periphery and ignoring the core issues should not become a preoccupation. A bureaucrat has various responsibilities, it is no doubt that he/she may miss or ignore something. But this should not be accepted in the legal framework. At a moral level, it can be accepted for few times but when it comes to law these mistakes could make pay heavy price. Because such mistakes lead us towards injustice and poor governance.\n\nSome examples in the above context:\n\n* Any negligence in passing a construction site could cause a heavy loss of life which will be a huge injustice.\n* If a bureaucrat is trying to know only whether the school is opening or not and neglecting whether the children are coming or not will lead towards poor governance.\n\n**(b):**A civil servant needs various qualities to tackle different crucial issues or take critical decisions. For this, he/she needs intellectual competency and moral qualities but this is not enough. Qualities such as compassion and empathy are equally important.\n\nLet\u2019s understand it with some examples:\n\n* An accident happened at some construction site and three people got seriously injured. The accident happened by mistake because a worker among them forgot to switch off some machines. Now, the officer present there has lots of pressure to punish the culprit. But the officer knows it was not intended by the worker. Here, the officer needs compassion and empathy to deal with this situation and should try to not give some stringent punishment to the worker.\n* Filling false dowry cases needs traits of compassion and empathy, otherwise, innocent people will get punished under the law.\n* In the covid-19 situation, many officers have worked tirelessly, they worked and helped beyond their working time limit. In such situations, traits like empathy and compassion are most needed in the civil servants especially for vulnerable sections of the society.\n\nHence, with intellectual competency and moral qualities, a person can take rational decisions but it is not necessary, that decision includes empathy and compassion.",

They use their discretion to harass the people.\n* They focus on implementation of the scheme and being insensitive to the issues arise during implementation of the scheme.\n* Example: Denying food grains at ration shop to a person because his biometrics details were not updated in the database due to connectivity issues.\n\n**(b):**Ethics is also known as moral philosophy which represents the values and customs of the society.

The ethical society is devoid of social crimes such as theft, rape, harassment, etc.\n\n**Ethics and Values in Human Life**\n\n* Person makes decision and implements in a transparent manner as it brings openness to that group of people which are affected by the decision.\n* Ethics ensures the malpractices like corruption is curbed in day-to-day life. Misconduct, abuse of power, and self-persecution has to be avoided.\n* Work commitment requires time, punctuality, and respect to fulfil the promises. Swami Vivekanand said, \u201cEvery duty is sacred and devotion to duty is the supreme form of worship\u201d.\n* Responsibility and accountability come with transparency.\n* A person must show sympathy in their actions towards the poor and disadvantaged section of society without breaking the law.\n\n**Role of Ethical Values in Resolution Conflict**\n\n* An ethical person resolves the conflict in accordance with law, justice, and compassion in the best interest of concerned societies while an unethical person resolves the conflict based on what is beneficial to him rather than society.\n* Empathy and compassion ensure that conflict resolution creates win-win situation for all.\n* The value of persistence helps an individual to follow \u2018never give attitude\u2019. The ethics also helps in anger management.\n* Ethics teaches us to forgive rather than holding grudges against each other.

      "explanation": "**(a):**Ethics is the study of what is right or wrong in human conduct. It is a branch of philosophy that involves systematizing, defending and recommending concepts of right and wrong behavior. Ethics seeks to resolve questions of human morality by defining concepts such as good and evil, right and wrong, virtue and vice, justice and crime.\n\n**What You have the Right to Do and What is Right to Do**\n\nArticle 19 of the Indian Constitution provides for Right to freedom of speech and expression. It gives rights to every citizen to hold public meetings, demonstrations and take out processions. However, it doesn\u2019t mean that citizens can block the road, railway and other transportation. Hence, holding strike and creating hurdles for others is not the right thing to do.\n\nSimilarly, under the Article 25, every citizen has freedom to profess, practice and propagate the religion. But, promoting religious conversion through bribery, coercion, violence is wrong and illegal action.\n\nUnder the PM Arogya Yojana, the Government offers a sum insured of Rs. 5 lakh per family for secondary care as well as tertiary care. But around 23,000 fraud transactions have been recorded in hospitals in Chhattisgarh, Punjab and Jharkhand. Here, beneficiaries have the right to utilise services, but its misuse defeats the purpose.\n\nTo conclude, it is ethics which help us in differentiating what we have the right to do and what is right to do. Rights are provided to live a better life, which help in capacity building of an individual, but its misuse defeat the very purpose.\n\n**(b):**Corruption is a form of dishonesty or a criminal offense which is undertaken by a person or an organisation which is entrusted in a position of authority, in order to acquire illicit benefits or abuse power for one's personal gain.\n\nA newborn child is like a blank slate. It is the parents and teachers, who give a shape to the child like a clay pot is given shape by its maker. In our childhood, our parents and teachers used to tell us moral stories. Through this, they inculcate values to make an asset and valuable citizen for our nation.\n\nIAS Armstrong Pame is the first member of Nagaland\u2019s Zeme tribe to become an IAS officer, earning the nickname \u201cMiracle Man\u201d for creating a 100-kilometre road connecting Manipur to Nagaland and Assam without any government assistance.\n\nBut, in August 2022, IAS officer K Rajesh was arrested for taking bribes for issuing arms licenses, allotment of government land to ineligible beneficiaries and grant of other illegal favours.\n\nThese two examples show the big difference in values of an individual. It is the failure of parents as they failed to inculcate the moral values to their child.\n\nIn the Corruption Perception Index 2021, India ranked 85 among 180 countries. Hence, India has a long way to go to become corruption-free. Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam has rightly said that it is role of parents and teachers to shape the future of India.\n\n**(c):**\n\nSuccess is something that you must define for yourself and no one can do it for you. Success could mean a sense of giving back to the world and making a difference. It could mean a sense of accomplishment and career progression.\n\nSuccess is the result of making right priorities and giving up less important things in your life. The Phogat sisters, Gita and Babita, sacrificed their childhood just to fulfill their father\u2019s dream of gold medal in wrestling. They had suffered a lot of pain to make India proud on them.\n\nThe aspirants who prepared for IIT and NEET, also do sacrifices their desires, just to clear the exam and live a better life. They have the responsibility of their families, to uplift them from poverty and give them better lifestyle.\n\nTo gain something big, we must pay the opportunity cost of some short-term pleasure. Mahatma Gandhi gave up his western clothing and adopted khadi dhoti. He went to jail to make India free. He knew that Indians would get independence by giving up western lifestyle and hegemony.\n\nHence, Dalai Lama has rightly said that one\u2019s success must be judged by the sacrifices he has to made to achieve his goals. By setting the priorities, we can achieve all our goals. Because failing individuals have given priorities to short term pleasure.",

It had helped successfully in identifying the potential hotspots.\n* **National Scholarships Portal (NSP):** It provides a centralized platform for application and disbursement of scholarship to students under any scholarship scheme.\n* **Bhoomi Project:** It is a self-sustainable e-Governance initiative for the computerised delivery of rural land records to farmers of Karnataka.\n* **e-Courts:** It is the mission mode project which aims at utilizing technology for improved provisioning of judicial services to the citizens.\n* **Digi Locker:** It aims at digital empowerment of citizens by providing access to authentic digital documents.\n* **PAYGOV India:** It will offer end-to-end transaction experience for a citizen which includes accessing various services through the internet with payment gateway interface for online payments.\n* **Pragati:** It is a unique integrated and interactive platform through which the Prime Minister oversees the implementation of various government schemes, grievances, state and central related projects & programmes by directly interacting with all stake holders through Videoconferencing on a single platform.\n\n**(b):**The advent of pandemic has led all activities, businesses, education, trade, health, and social interactions to an online mode.

In India, whistleblowers are protected by the Whistleblowers Protection Act, 2014.\n\n**Policy measures to strengthen protection mechanisms to safeguard the whistle blower**\n\n* There are various policy measures regarding protection of whistle-blowers but their implementation is very poor. It is important that policies should be implemented properly for their safety.\n* Submitting the issue as an anonymous person will protect the life of the Whistle blower.\n* Specific training to teach workers their rights and about available internal and external protection programs, and for managers to learn these along with related skills, behaviours and obligations to act.\n* Suitable legislation must be enacted to provide protection to innocent whistleblowers and the dilution of the act that is proposed by the 2015 Amendment Bill must be abandoned.\n\nHence, strengthening of the whistleblower protection mechanism will help in ensuring that the integrity of democracy is protected, cherished and upheld.\n\n**(b):**The term \"Corporate Social Responsibility\" in general can be referred to as a corporate initiative to assess and take responsibility for the company's effects on the environment and impact on social welfare. The activities include eradicating extreme hunger and poverty, ensuring environmental sustainability, etc.\n\nSome of the Features of the CSR are:\n\n* Self-Regulating Model: Corporate social responsibility (CSR) is a self-regulating business model that helps a company be socially accountable\u2014to itself, its stakeholders, and the public.\n* Improved Work Culture: CSR activities can help forge a stronger bond between employees and corporations, boost morale and help both employees and employers feel more connected with the world around them.\n* Corporate Citizenship: By practicing corporate social responsibility, also called corporate citizenship, companies can be conscious of the kind of impact they are having on all aspects of society, including economic, social, and environmental.\n\nAlthough the corporate sector is generating wealth no doubt there is a huge gap in the wealth division, rich are getting richer day by day and the poor are becoming more poor which is against social welfare. Even though the Companies Act encourages companies to invest almost 2% of their average net profit in CSR activities but that will not be enough to counter environmental and climatic problems.",

The environmental clearance seeks to curb industries and projects that supposedly hamper environment and living species in the region.

It was confirmed that majority of the industries were violating environmental compliance. You issued notice to all the industrial units to apply for fresh environmental clearance certificate from the competent authority. However, your action met with hostile response from a section of the industrial units, other vested interest persons and a section of the local politicians. The workers also became very hostile to you as they felt that your action would lead to the closure these of industrial units, and the resultant unemployment will lead to insecurity and uncertainty in their livelihood. Many owners of the industries approached you with the plea that you should not initiate harsh action as it would compel them their units, and cause huge Financial loss, shortage of their products in the market. These would obviously add to the sufferings of the labourers and the consumer alike. The labour union also sent you representation requesting against the closure of the units.

Under the given scenario I have two options:\n\n* I can take direct action and close all the industries hampering the environment, without analysing its immediate consequences like unemployment among workers, protests from labour unions, increased health issues due to a decrease in purchasing capacity of medicines, etc.\n* The second option is that I would call a meeting with all the owners of the industries and environmental NGOs and talk with them to come to some common ground like setting a limit on using harmful elements and using better alternatives wherever available or possible, and with the help of the NGOs convince the medium industries to take new environmental clearance etc.\n\n**(b)** In the first option, I am only completing my prescribed duty without analysing its long-term effect. In the immediate effect maybe health problems or pollution will be reduced but in the long term this decision has various other consequences like poverty, health deterioration due to poverty, other indirect environmental issues can happen due to plague etc.\n\n* In the second option, I am considering the issue of everyone. There will be no direct shutdown of industries. Talking with every section of society and coming to the common ground is the best possible method. This may not show a positive result in the short term but in the long term it will reduce pollution without creating protests or unemployment.\n\n**(c)** The environmental compliances suggested by me would be:\n\n* Dividing industries into two categories, based on their harmful effect on the environment. Then, apply the tighter rules on the most harmful industries.\n* Every industry will clean their own waste. And every industry must have water treatment plants.\n* Use of sustainable alternative elements for harmful chemicals. And complete stoppage the elements or chemicals which are harming the environment most.\n* New environment clearance must be taken by the second category industries (most harmful industries) etc.\n* Monetary penalties must be given by the industries that will use the restricted chemicals and pollute the environment above the prescribed limit.\n\n**(d)** The ethical dilemma which I will face is between the completion of duty and compassion and empathy towards migrant workers. Completion of duty is not would be rational but taking decisions with compassion and empathy toward migrant workers will be rational, moral and ethical. Another ethical dilemma which I will face will be between protecting the environment and protecting jobs.",

      "explanation": "Since the inception of the 1st five-year plan, the government has worked on a plethora of welfare schemes for the vulnerable sections of the society. While these schemes are beneficial to a particular section, protest against them are not unheard of.\n\n**The concept of positive discrimination**\n\n* It is the act of providing benefits to a particular section of society, based on a history of discrimination against them.\n  + For example, providing reservations to Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribes compensating for the inhuman treatment they have went through in the past.\n* This approach focuses on \u2018Equity\u2019 rather than \u2018Equality\u2019, thereby recognizing the difference in the requirements of groups to reach a certain standard of living.\n\n**Why it is needed**\n\n* Past disadvantages of certain communities made them so deprived that without affirmative action it is difficult to enhance their social, educational, political and economic levels.\n* Geographical differences in India make it necessary to provide additional benefits to certain locations.\n  + For example, the Northeast Special Infrastructure Development Scheme (NESIDS).\n* Gender inequalities have existed in our nation for very long, with problems such as female infanticide and child marriage being embedded in the very fabric of our society.\n  + Therefore, schemes such as Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao and Kishori Shakti Yojna are important.\n* Economic differences throughout the society that seemingly have their roots in the caste system make it very difficult for the disadvantaged groups to come out of the deep economic pit. Dedicated economic upliftment plans are needed to support these groups.\n  + For example, Jan Dhan Yojna and merit-based scholarships to SC/ST students.\n\nTherefore, while it is true that welfare schemes for the vulnerable are indeed discriminatory in nature, it must be kept in mind that this \u2018positive discrimination\u2019 is done to compensate for the decades of injustice that had been done against them.",

      "explanation": "While the world seems to be embracing the concept of multipolar world quite well, it is no doubt that NATO and European Union remain the centres of power internationally. India looks forward to becoming a major power in the coming years but for now it will also benefit from a strengthened NATO and US-Europe relationship.\n\n**Why it works for India**\n\n* **China Problem:** Since NATO and EU seem to be in consensus on the Chinese aggression problem, it is in favour of India to engage in strategic partnerships with them.\n* **Economic Returns:** The amount of world GDP that is held by these countries is enormous. India will benefit from trade relations from these countries and additionally from the politico-economic stability that is brought about by their partnership.\n* **Democratic Values:** Shared ideological values of democracy that are being upheld by these groupings aligns with India's interest as contrasted against its two hostile neighbours.\n* **Defence Capabilities:** Increased engagement with the western military, will benefit India in terms of technological know-how, advanced military trainings, and strategic collaboration.\n* **Tackling Terrorism:** India being a country with history of dealing with terrorist attacks would greatly appreciate any effort towards ending or at least mitigating terrorism which would be an indirect benefit of the US-Europe strategic partnership.\n\n**Few challenges**\n\n* **India-Russia Relations:** A closeness with the western countries would have to be done in a way that does not offend India's relationship with its long-term partner, Russia. Balancing between USA and Russia is a test of Indian diplomacy.\n* **Increased Competition:** A stronger EU and US relationship would mean an increased competition in sectors where India is trying to grow, e.g., IT industry and pharmaceuticals.\n\nOverall, India would benefit immensely from a strengthened NATO and a stronger US-Europe strategic partnership if it can tackle the challenges that come with it.",

Each has strengths and limitations, with superiority context-dependent.\n\n* **Conscience:**\n  + **Strengths:**\n    - **Personal Morality:** An internal moral compass that can guide ethical decision-making based on one's personal sense of right and wrong.\n    - **Flexibility:** Conscience values complexity and uniqueness, allowing for thoughtful consideration of individual situations beyond established laws.\n  + **Limitations:**\n    - **Influence of Bias:** Conscience influenced by biases, culture, upbringing can lead to questionable ethics.\n    - **Inconsistent Application:** Conscience can evolve, leading to inconsistency in ethical choices.\n* **Laws, Rules, and Regulations:**\n  + **Strengths:**\n    - **Clarity:** They establish ethical guidelines for society and organizations.\n    - **Accountability:** They impose consequences for wrongdoing, discouraging unethical actions.\n    - **Protection of Rights:** Laws and regulations can protect the rights and well-being of individuals and society as a whole.\n  + **Limitations:**\n    - **Rigidity:** Laws often struggle to keep pace with changing social norms and evolving ethics.\n    - **Moral Blind Spots:** Legal systems may not fully address all ethical dilemmas.\n    - **Enforcement:** Enforcing laws is tough, and unethical behavior can persist through loopholes.\n\nConscience and laws/rules/regulations play crucial roles in ethical decisions. Conscience relies on universal ethics and bias control, while laws offer structure but need regular updates to stay fair.\n\n**(b):**Probity means adherence to the highest principles and ideals. It is the foundation of moral principles like honesty and integrity. It's crucial for good governance and socio-economic progress, as it ensures officials prioritize the public, adhere to the law, and uphold transparency and accountability.\n\nProbity in governance affects various aspects of socio-economic development:\n\n* **Resource allocation:** Probity in governance means efficient and corruption-free resource allocation.\n* **Promotes competition:** Probity fosters innovation and fair competition, eliminating cronyism, nepotism, and favoritism for an equitable economy.\n* **Equity:** It ensures fair, impartial policies, respecting all citizens, especially the marginalized.\n* **Reduces inequalities**: Probity reduces inequality by preventing public officials from using their power for personal gain.\n* **Inclusion:** It ensures that public services and facilities are accessible and affordable to all citizens, without any discrimination or exclusion.\n* **Sustainability:** Probity in governance means making decisions that consider environmental, social, and economic sustainability for both current and future generations.\n* **Enhances resilience:** It boosts society's resilience by preparing officials to handle natural disasters, climate change, and pandemics effectively.\n\nProbity in governance is vital for effective government, trust, transparency, and societal progress.

This monotheistic doctrine promotes religious tolerance and unity, which is crucial in a world marked by religious diversity and conflicts.\n* **Equality and Social Justice:** Guru Nanak championed equality, inspiring Sikhism's values of justice, gender parity, and service. His teachings remain a beacon of hope in our modern struggle against discrimination and inequality.\n* **Selfless Service (Seva)**: Guru Nanak promoted 'Seva,' selfless service to humanity, fostering compassion, altruism, and a sense of responsibility, still relevant today.\n* **Interfaith Dialogue:** Guru Nanak fostered interfaith harmony through dialogues, stressing unity in diversity. His teachings remain vital for global peace and coexistence.\n* **Rejecting Rituals and Superstitions:** Guru Nanak rejected empty rituals and superstitions, emphasizing a personal connection with God, which appeals to those seeking a deeper, more meaningful faith.\n\nIn the contemporary world, Guru Nanak's teachings inspire inclusive, compassionate, and harmonious societies, addressing modern issues like religious intolerance and social inequality, guiding us toward a more enlightened and equitable future.\n\n**(b):**Social capital is the network of connections, trust, and shared values within a community that fosters effective collaboration and the pursuit of common objectives. Social capital plays a crucial role in enhancing good governance in several ways:\n\n* It can foster civic engagement and participation, which can increase the accountability and responsiveness of governance institutions.\n* It can facilitate collective action and problem-solving, which can improve the delivery of public goods and services.\n* It can promote social cohesion and inclusion, which can reduce conflicts and violence and enhance social justice.\n* It can reduce transaction costs and information asymmetries, and increase coordination and cooperation among different actors.\n* It can stimulate innovation and learning, which can enhance the adaptability and effectiveness of governance systems.\n\nSocial capital is crucial for good governance, fostering trust, cooperation, civic engagement, and collective action. Recognizing its value, governments should actively nurture and safeguard social capital to enhance democratic institutions and societal well-being.",

The landslide was caused by torrential rains and has resulted in large-scale destruction of property and life. You, as District Magistrate of that area, have rushed to the spot with a team of doctors, NGOs, media and police along with numerous support staff to oversee the rescue operations. A man came running to you with a request for urgent medical help for his pregnant wife who is in labour and is losing blood. You directed your medical team to examine his wife. They return and convey to you that this woman needs blood transfusion immediately. Upon enquiry, you come to know that a few blood collection bags and blood group test kits are available in the ambulance accompanying your team. Few people of your team have already volunteered to donate blood. Being a physician who has graduated from AIIMS, you know that blood for transfusion needs to be procured only through a recognized blood bank.

These are visible only at night, and usually only appear in lower polar regions. Auroras primarily appear near the poles of both the northern and southern hemispheres all year round but sometimes they expand to lower latitudes.\n\n### Body\n\n**Types of Aurora**\n\n* **Aurora Australis (Southern Lights):** Visible in the Southern Hemisphere, especially around the Antarctic Circle, in countries like Australia, New Zealand, Antarctica, and southern parts of South America.\n* **Aurora Borealis (Northern Lights):** Seen near the Arctic Circle, caused by solar particles interacting with Earth\u2019s magnetic field and atmosphere. It displays green, red, and purple lights in countries like Norway, Sweden, Finland, Iceland, Canada, and Alaska.\n\n**Auroras are Triggered By**\n\n* **Solar Winds:** Interaction of Solar Wind particles produced by sun with earth magnetic fields trigger auroras.\n* **Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs):** CMEs are huge bubbles of coronal plasma threaded by intense magnetic field lines that are ejected from the Sun over the course of several hours. These can enhance auroral activity by increasing the number of charged particles reaching Earth.\n* **Magnetosphere Disturbances:** It plays a crucial role in triggering auroras. When the solar wind, which consists of charged particles from the Sun, interacts with Earth\u2019s magnetosphere, it causes disturbances.\n* **Atmospheric Interaction:** Charged particles, primarily electrons and protons, are directed towards the polar regions by Earth\u2019s magnetic field. When these particles collide with gases in the upper atmosphere, they excite these gasses, resulting in the emission of light.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAuroras are the outcome of intricate space weather events, showcasing the dynamic interplay between Earth\u2019s magnetic field and solar activity. The recent occurrence of which was seen at Hanle village in Ladakh in the form of aurora borealis.",

However, urban settings also expose them to harassment and violence, with inadequate support systems.\n  + Rising crime rates against women (NCRB data 2014-2022) emphasize the need for better protections alongside empowerment.\n* **Pressure on Traditional Family Structures:** Migration shifts families from joint to nuclear structures, allowing women greater autonomy in partner selection and marriage timing, often conflicting with traditional family expectations.\n* **Cultural Transformations:** Women navigate between urban lifestyles and traditional values, redefining gender roles through success in urban workplaces. They balance personal aspirations with financial responsibilities, creating new interdependent family dynamics.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nUrban migration is essential for economic growth and personal development.

Union of India (1984)** set the precedent for liberalising access to the courts for social justice causes.\n* **Inaction of Government Authorities:** Growth of PILs can be attributed to the failure of government agencies to address public grievances effectively (bureaucratic delays, corruption etc), leading citizens to approach courts through PILs.\n\n**Growth of PILs Making the SC the World\u2019s Most Powerful Judiciary:**\n\n* **Power to Strike Down Laws:**\n  + In 2021, the Supreme Court declared the **NJAC Act and the 99th Constitutional Amendment unconstitutional and void** (PIL challenging NJAC Act filed in 2015).\n* **Addressing Government Inaction via Judicial Review:**\n  + In M.C. Mehta v. Union of India (1988), the court issued directives to control pollution and improve Ganga's water quality.\n  + In the NEET 2024 paper leak case, the SC denied a retest due to insufficient evidence of compromised exam integrity and expanded the Centre-appointed panel\u2019s scope to review NTA's functioning and recommend reforms.\n* **Wider Interpretation of Rights:**\n  + The SC held the **right to privacy** as an intrinsic part of the right to life and personal libe rty under Article 21 (Puttaswamy case 2017).\n  + The SC recognised the **rights of sex workers to dignity** and expanded the interpretation of the right to life and dignity under Article 21 (Budhadev Karmaskar case 2022).\n* **Sou Motu Powers:**\n  + After the poor handling of the Kolkata Muder-Rape case 2024 by the state govt, the SC took the suo motu cognisance of the incident.\n* **Judicial Activism and Overreach:**\n  + Overturning a colonial-era law by decriminalising homosexuality (Navtej Singh Johar case) and declaring triple talaq as unconstitutional and invalid, upholding gender equality and personal rights (Shayara Bano case 2017).\n  + To curb road accidents, the SC ordered a ban on liquor sales within 500 m of highways (2017).\n\nThough PILs have expanded the ambit of judicial review and have contributed in making the SC one of the world\u2019s most powerful judiciary \u2013 judicial overreach has often been criticised by various stakeholders as excessively interfering in the legislative and executive domains; a practice witnessed seldom in more advanced nations like the US and Australia who also have similar systems in place. \u2018Separation of powers\u2019 must be respected to maintain the spirit of democracy.",

This led to inconsistency and unequal service delivery.\n  + Many officials perceive the Citizen's Charter as an additional burden and show reluctance in adhering to its standards.\n  + **Insufficient training** of public officials in **citizen-centric service delivery** and a lack of understanding of the Citizen's Charter hinder its effective implementation.\n* **Measures to Overcome the Challenges:**\n  + The **Second Administrative Reforms Commission (ARC)** proposed several recommendations to enhance the effectiveness of **Citizen\u2019s Charters:**\n    - Implementing **punitive measures** for non-compliance, such as **financial penalties** or disciplinary action against officials, can improve accountability.\n    - Charters should prioritize a limited number of achievable commitments instead of presenting an extensive list of unfulfilled promises.\n    - Uniform charters across organizations can undermine the effectiveness of service delivery; therefore, it is essential to develop charter that are tailored to local contexts and specific organizational needs.\n    - Officers should be held accountable when commitments made in the Citizen's Charters are not met, ensuring that they uphold their responsibilities and maintain public trust.\n    - Citizen\u2019s Charters should undergo frequent reviews and revisions to ensure they remain relevant, effective, and aligned with changing needs and expectations of the public.\n    - Before creating a charter, the organization should reorganize its structure and processes to ensure effective implementation.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe Citizen's Charter has the potential to revolutionize governance by enhancing transparency, efficiency, and a focus on citizens. However, realizing this potential requires tackling implementation challenges through increased awareness, improved accountability, effective training, and fostering a culture centered on citizen needs.",

While AI can enhance efficiency and objectivity, it raises profound ethical questions.\n\n### Body:\n\n![](TEST_IMAGES/UPSC_MAIN_CSE_GS_2024_PAPER_4_Q1_IMG_1.png)\n\n* AI's reliance on data-driven algorithms **diminishes the role of human intuition and ethical reasoning,** resulting in decisions that lack contextual understanding.\n* Determining **responsibility** becomes problematic when AI decisions cause harm, making it unclear whether the fault lies with developers, operators, or the AI itself.\n* AI systems can inadvertently **reinforce biases** present in training data, leading to discriminatory outcomes that disproportionately affect marginalized communities.\n* Many AI algorithms function as \"black boxes,\" making it difficult for stakeholders to grasp the decision-making process, thereby **undermining trust and transparancy.**\n* AI systems often require large amounts of data, raising concerns about **data privacy,** consent, and potential misuse of personal information.\n\nHowever, AI significantly **enhances efficiency and accuracy** in administrative tasks, streamlining processes and boosting citizen satisfaction. Additionally, AI if used properly can improve administration by bringing in **objectivity.**\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nTo harness AI responsibly in administration, it is imperative to address ethical challenges, ensuring that human values, accountability, and social justice are prioritized in decision-making processes.\n\n**(b):**\n\n### Approach:\n\n* Introduce by highlighting the importance of ethics influencing human actions.\n* Mention dimensions of ethics like deontology, teleology and virtue ethics etc and evaluate.\n* Conclude suitably.\n\n### Introduction:\n\nEthics is a framework of principles that guide moral behavior in individuals and organizations. Key dimensions of ethics influence human actions, shaping values and standards that inform decision-making processes, particularly in professional settings where consequences can be significant.\n\n### Body:\n\nThe key dimensions of ethics and their role in shaping ethical decision-making are:-\n\n* **Normative Ethics** establishes moral standards that guide individuals and organizations in evaluating right and wrong actions.\n  + By providing frameworks for navigating moral dilemmas, it significantly shapes decision-making processes.\n* **Virtue Ethics** emphasizes the importance of moral character and the cultivation of virtues such as honesty and courage.\n  + This focus encourages professionals to develop good habits, fostering ethical behavior and creating a collaborative, trustworthy organizational culture.\n* **Deontological Ethics** asserts that certain actions are inherently right or wrong, highlighting the importance of duties and obligations.\n  + It guides professionals to uphold rights and ethical standards, ensuring integrity even under pressure.\n* **Teleological Ethics** evaluates actions based on their outcomes, motivating professionals to consider the broader impact of their decisions.\n  + This perspective promotes practices that benefit both business interests and society.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nGandhi's \"Seven Sins\" highlight key ethical dimensions: wealth without work emphasises normative ethics, pleasure without conscience reflects virtue ethics, and knowledge without character underscores integrity. These principles guide individuals and organisations toward responsible behaviour in personal and professional contexts.",

By learning from others and filtering that knowledge through our own experiences, we cultivate authenticity and resilience.\n  + **E.g,** Mahatma Gandhi drew on teachings from **Jesus and Leo Tolstoy** to develop his philosophy of **Satyagraha.**\n* **Societal level:** The quote emphasises that cultures evolve by selectively adopting beneficial elements from others, enriching society while **preserving local identity** and harmonizing external influences with traditional customs.\n  + **Example:** The Indian music industry harmonizes **Western influences with traditional regional sounds,** creating a unique fusion that reflects the diverse cultural heritage of India. **Global brands** like McDonald's adapt to local tastes with items like the **McAloo Tikki Burger,** and the **internationalization of yoga** illustrates this harmonious blend.\n* **National level:** The quote emphasizes that countries should learn from global innovations and adapt them to their unique contexts.\n  + **E.g, The Digital India initiative** exemplifies globalisation tailored to Indian needs by using global technologies to improve **digital literacy and internet access** in rural areas.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nSwami Vivekananda\u2019s quote advocates for a harmonious balance between learning from others and celebrating one\u2019s own heritage, leading to a more enriched and authentic life.\n\n**(b):**\n\n### Approach:\n\n* **Introduction:** Highlight the importance of the interplay between faith and strength.\n* **Body:** Discuss the relevance of faith and strength in various contexts.\n* **Conclusion:** Emphasize synergy between faith and strength for achieving meaningful goals.\n\n### Introduction\n\nSardar Patel\u2019s quote highlights the interplay between faith and strength in achieving goals: faith offers vision, while **strength provides the resilience to pursue it. Without strength, faith is just aspiration**; without faith, strength lacks purpose.\n\n### Body\n\n**Relevance of Faith and Strength's Interplay in the Present Context:**\n\n* For a Public Servant, faith provides a vision for a better society, while strength ensures dedication to implement reforms **without corruption.** Both are essential for effective progress.\n  + E.g., **Sardar Patel's** vision of a **unified India** emerged through diplomatic strength, while **Nelson Mandela's** faith and activists' strength ended **apartheid,** leading to a free South Africa.\n* Social Movements like **Black Lives Matter** and environmental activism demonstrate how a **strong belief in justice (faith)** must be matched by the organizational strength to drive change.\n* Successful **entrepreneurs** embody this interplay, as their vision (faith) must be matched with resilience and strategic execution (strength) to overcome setbacks in competitive markets.\n  + E,g., Elon Musk's faith in electric vehicles and reusable rockets highlights how belief and strength help him overcome challenges and achieve his ambitious vision.\n* Nations advance through shared faith and effective reforms. The **Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam philosophy** promotes global harmony, as seen in India's **Vaccine Maitri initiative** and programs like **Swachh Bharat Abhiyan** and the **SDGs.**\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBy developing both qualities, we can overcome challenges and reach our goals and to achieve greatness, we must recognize faith and strength as essential foundations for success.\n\n**(c):**\n\n### Approach:\n\n* **Introduction:** Emphasize the distinction between legal and ethical culpability.\n* **Body:** Highlight the relevance of conscience in ethical consideration in present context citing examples.\n* **Conclusion:** Emphasize the importance of personal responsibility and ethical intentions.\n\n### Introduction\n\nImmanuel Kant's quote highlights the distinction between legal and ethical culpability. The law focuses on actions that violate others' rights, while ethics consider intentions and thoughts. An action may be legal but still morally wrong if it has malicious intent.\n\n### Body\n\n**Relevance in Present Context:**\n\n* **Role of Conscience:** Conscience is the inner sense of right and wrong that guides moral decisions. It is essential for upholding ethical standards by prompting individuals to **prioritise others' welfare over personal gain**, even when legal obligations allow otherwise. A strong conscience **fosters accountability and ensures actions** align with moral principles.\n  + E.g, a **whistleblower** reports unethical practices, prioritizing public good over job security due to their strong conscience.\n* **Corporate Responsibility:** Corporates might legally avoid taxes through loopholes, but ethically, this could be seen as **wrong if the intent is to evade fair contribution to society.**\n* **Digital Era:** Hate speech and online trolling often evade legal punishment but carry serious ethical consequences, highlighting the need for urgent attention to their impact.\n* **Workplace Ethics:** An employer might legally follow all labour laws, but ethically, they could be at fault if they exploit workers or create a toxic work environment.\n\nHowever, Kant's view is challenged by evolving ethics; for instance, **adultery** is now decriminalized in India but remains widely regarded as unethical.\n\nThus, Kant's insight encourages us to cultivate a sense of moral responsibility that transcends legal obligations, urging individuals to consider the implications of their thoughts.",

What was deemed just in one era can shift with changing contexts, necessitating ongoing scrutiny to ensure fair and equitable outcomes in society.\n\n### Body:\n\nThe concepts of just and unjust require constant scrutiny to prevent injustice -\n\n* The 19th-century abolition of the Sati system marked a shift, recognizing harmful practices as unjust.\n* Historically seen as just, the role of women as housewives is now challenged by contemporary views advocating for gender equality and career opportunities.\n* Once accepted, caste-based discrimination is increasingly viewed as unjust and various provisions have been inflicted to mitigate the impact of this injustice.\n* The 2018 decriminalization of homosexuality reflects changing societal values, affirming LGBTQ+ rights previously marginalized.\n* The 2019 ban on triple talaq represented a step toward justice for Muslim women, challenging outdated and unjust practices.\n\nConstant scrutiny of changing contexts is essential to ensure that our understanding of justice evolves with societal values. This vigilance helps prevent outdated practices from perpetuating injustice and promotes equitable treatment for all individuals, fostering a fair and just society.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe shifting nature of justice requires continuous examination of societal contexts. For example, capital punishment, once deemed just in ancient times, is viewed as unjust today. Similarly, the varying marriage ages 18 for girls and 21 for boys reflect current norms.\n\n**(b):**\n\n### Introduction:\n\n* Approach:\n* Introduce the answer by highlighting the difference between form and substance.\n* Explain negative consequences of strict adherence to form, with a brief example.\n* Highlight importance of substance in decision-making, illustrating a relevant case.\n* Describe qualities of a perceptive civil servant (discernment, empathy, moral courage).\n* Conclude suitably.\n\n### Introduction\n\nThe tension between form and substance is critical in administrative processes. Strict adherence to procedures can cause injustices, while an insightful civil servant prioritizes substance over form, ensuring fair outcomes that reflect the law's true intent.\n\n### Body:\n\n1. **Overemphasis on Rules:** Strict adherence to bureaucratic procedures can overshadow the actual needs of citizens, as seen in cases where applications are rejected due to minor technicalities rather than substantive issues.\n2. **Judicial Discretion:** Judges who focus solely on legal formalities may deliver unjust verdicts, while those who consider the broader context can achieve equitable outcomes, such as leniency in sentencing based on mitigating circumstances.\n3. **Social Welfare Programs:** Implementation of welfare schemes often suffers when officials prioritize paperwork over community needs, resulting in essential services being delayed or denied.\n4. **Discretionary Powers:** Civil servants using discretion wisely can adapt policies to suit specific situations, promoting justice, as illustrated by interventions in cases of domestic violence where standard procedures might fail to protect victims.\n\nA rigid **Code of Conduct** is essential for civil servants, defining expected behaviors. In contrast, the Code of Ethics provides moral principles that ensure just outcomes by aligning actions with the law's true intent.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nInstilling the Nolan Principles in civil servants, we can shift their focus from the letter to the spirit of the law. This approach fosters empathy and compassion, ensuring justice aligns with the true intent of regulations.",

The problem of unemployment amongst graduates and those with higher education was much more grave. Thus they were vulnerable and soft targets.**  **In the review meeting taken by him with senior officers of DIG Range and above, it came to light that a new terrorist group has emerged at the global level. It has launched a massive drive to recruit young unemployed people. Special focus was to pick young people from a particular community.The said organisation seemed to have the clear objective of utilising/using them for carrying out militant activities.

Rohit is posted as SP (Special Operations) for the last one year, in one of the districts which is still affected by the naxalite problem. The district administration has taken a lot of developmental works in the recent past in the naxalite affected areas to win the hearts and minds of the people. Over a period of time, Rohit has established an excellent intelligence network to get the real time information regarding the movement of naxalite cadre. To instill confidence in the public and have moral ascendancy over the naxalites, a number of cordons and search operations are being conducted by the police. Rohit, who himself was leading one of the contingents got a message though his intelligence source that about ten hard core naxalites were hiding in a particular village with sophisticated weapons. Without wasting any time, Rohit reached the target village with his team and laid out a foolproof cordon and started carrying out a systematic search.

However, if he did not release the naxalites, the situation could get out of control since the tribal women were aggressively charging towards them.

      "question_text": "**Q11. With the summer heat being exceptionally severe this year, the district has been facing severe water shortage. The District Collector has been mobilizing his subordinate officials to conserve the remaining water reserves for preventing the district from plunging into acute drinking water crisis.**  **Along with an awareness campaign for conserving water, strict measures have been taken for stopping the over-exploitation of ground-water. Vigilance teams have been deployed to tour the villages and find the farmers who are drawing water from deep borewells or from the river reservoir for irrigation. The farmers are agitated by such action. A delegation of farmers meets the District Collector with their issues and complains that while they are not being allowed to irrigate their crops, big industries located near the river are drawing huge amounts of water through deep borewells for their industrial processes. The farmers allege that their administration is anti-farmer and corrupt, being bribed by the industry. The district needs to placate the farmers as they are threatening to go on a prolonged protest. At the same time, the District Collector has to deal with the water crisis. The industry cannot be closed as this would result in a large number of workers being unemployed.**  **(a) Discuss all options available to the District Collector as a District Magistrate.**  **(b) What suitable actions can be taken in view of mutually compatible interests of the stakeholders?**  **(c) What are the potential administrative and ethical dilemmas for the District Collector ?**  **(Answer in 250 words)**",

      "explanation": "### Approach:\n\n* Give a brief introduction about the situation\n* Mention all the options available to DC\n* State the suitable action that can be taken\n* Highlight the potential administrative and ethical dilemmas\n* Conclude suitably\n\n### Introduction:\n\nThe District Collector (DC) is dealing with a severe water shortage amid farmer protests over restrictions on groundwater use. Farmers accuse the administration of bias towards industries, while industrial operations cannot be halted due to employment concerns.\n\n### Body:\n\n**(a) All the options available to the DC as a District Magistrate.**\n\n* **Enforce Water Restrictions:** Strictly implement water conservation measures for both farmers and industries.\n* **Temporary Restrictions on Industries:** Impose temporary water usage limits and assist industries in adopting efficient water-use technologies.\n* **Equitable Water Sharing:** Facilitate negotiations between farmers and industries for fair water distribution, possibly through rationing or water-saving technologies.\n* **Alternative Water Sources:** Explore options like transporting water from nearby districts, rainwater harvesting, recycling in industries, or tapping external sources.\n\n**(b) What suitable actions can be taken in view of mutually compatible interests of the stakeholders?**\n\n* **Equitable Water Distribution:** Implement water rationing for agriculture and industries, encouraging water-efficient technologies and limited irrigation.\n* **Promote Water Conservation:** Provide incentives for farmers to adopt drip irrigation and encourage industries to recycle wastewater.\n* **Public Awareness:** Expand water conservation campaigns to highlight collective responsibility and reduce farmer frustration.\n* **Grievance Redressal**: Establish a multi-stakeholder platform for farmers and industries to promote communication and resolve conflicts.\n\n**(c) What are the potential administrative and ethical dilemmas for the District Collector?**\n\n* **Equity vs. Efficiency**: The Collector must balance fair water distribution between farmers and industries without compromising economic productivity. Favoring either could result in inefficiency or perceived bias.\n* **Farmers' Interests vs. Industrial Interests:** The challenge lies in meeting the water needs of both farmers and industries, as favoring one can create unrest among the other group.\n* **Transparency vs. Corruption:** Ensuring transparency while addressing farmers\u2019 concerns of favoritism and corruption is a key ethical dilemma for the Collector.\n* **Public Trust vs. Long-term Sustainability:** The Collector must balance immediate public demands with sustainable water management to prevent future crises. Short-term gains shouldn't undermine long-term sustainability.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe DC should ensure equitable water sharing, promote stakeholder dialogue, and implement water-saving technologies to resolve the crisis while maintaining public trust and economic stability.",

Dr. Srinivasan is a senior scientist working for a reputed biotechnology company known for its cutting-edge research in pharmaceuticals.**  **Dr. Srinivasan is heading a research team working on a new drug aimed at treating a rapidly spreading variant of a new viral infectious disease. The disease has been rapidly spreading across the world and the cases reported in the country are increasing. There is huge pressure on Dr. Srinivasan\u2019s team to expedite the trials for the drug as there is significant market for it, and the company wants to get the first-mover advantage in the market. During a team meeting, some senior team members suggest some shortcut for expediting the clinical trials for the drug and for getting the requisite approvals. These include manipulating data to exclude some negative outcomes and selectively reporting positive results, foregoing the process of informed consent and using compounds already patented by a rival company, rather than developing one\u2019s own component. Dr. Srinivasan is not comfortable taking such shortcuts, at the same time he realises meeting the targets is impossible without using these means.**  **(a) What would you do in such a situation?**  **(b) Examine your options and consequences in the light of the ethical**  **questions involved.**  **(c) How can data ethics and drug ethics save humanity at large in such a scenario?**  **(Answer in 250 words)**",
