      "explanation": "Education and health care are some of basic human right to which all human beings are entitled to. The Supreme Court has from time to time interpreted Article 21 of the Constitution and has brought \u2018Right to health\u2019 and \u2018right to primary education\u2019 (Article 21A) under fundamental rights. Therefore, both primary education and health care is an important aspect for a democratic set up.\n\nProf. Amartya Sen have lamented about the primary education and health care situation in India and advocated for reforms. According to him:\n\n* Without developing social sectors like school education and basic health-care services, and without carrying outland reforms, it will not be possible for India to have a participatory and widely shared economic growth.\n* Education and health care are not only vital for quality of life, they have much to contribute to economic development and social change.\n* India needs to broaden its base in the spheres of education, healthcare and women\u2019s equality to foster economic growth.\n* India ranks alongside Haiti and Sierra Leone when it comes to government spending on health as a share of the total health expenditure of the people.\n* He has made a strong case for a radical reform in primary school curriculum which would reduce the curriculum overload in primary education in the country, making home tasks redundant and private tuition unnecessary.\n* The government must prioritise expenditure on education and healthcare instead of ill-directed subsidies and tax exemptions.\n\n**Suggestions for improvement in primary education and health care**\n\n* Increasing the government expenditure on primary education and health care to atleast 5% of GDP. While the government spends only 1% of GDP on health, education spending in India has been lower than the world average.\n* There is a need for proper utilization of funds by plugging the loopholes arising from procedural and institutional bottlenecks.\n* Taking inspiration from the Yashpal Committee Report which seeks to make learning more meaningful and enjoyable by relating formal education to the living world of the children.\n* The mantra of availability, affordability, and assurance must be followed for improving status and performance of Health care in India.\n* Expanding the reach of health services to rural and remote areas is hindered by the limited availability of providers there. Therefore there is a need to improve the quality of Public Health Centres in those areas.\n* Cooperation and collaboration of both public and private sectors.\n\nIndia is the only country in the world which is aiming to become a global economic power with an uneducated and unhealthy labour force. Effective implementation of existing policies for skill development, fundamental education reforms, public private partnership and international collaborations can help the nation to become a global superpower.",

    "solution": {
      "explanation": "Traditional bureaucratic structure and culture is primarily identified with the maintenance of law and order, collection of revenues and regulation of national life. In this sense, it is status-quoist and regulatory in nature.\n\nIt is based on centralized decision-making. People are not given participation in administration and the decision-making process. It is known for its rigidity, centralization of power and procedure oriented consequently, the rules and regulations which were supposed to be the means to development have become an end in themselves, resulting in goal displacement. An example of this is the now dismantled Planning Commission which failed to keep pace with the changing socio-economic environment. Centralised state-led planning had been futile and redundant to address specific issues which never received adequate attention in the one-size-fits-all formula. Its replacement, the NITI Aayog is conceptualized to follow a bottoms-up approach supporting formulation. In the era of rolling-back of the state and globalization, there is a need for the bureaucracy to be downsized and confine itself to core functions that cannot be performed by market. There is a need for a result oriented bureaucracy which focuses on outcomes, is people-centric, participatory responsive and focused on effectiveness and equity rather than merely efficiency.\n\nWith the opening up of the economy with the 1991 reforms, things have gradually shifted. Bureaucracy now playing the role of an enabler, rather than \u2018doer\u2019. Public administration now focuses on good governance. Also, steps such as the 73rd and 74th Constitutional Amendment Acts have been steps in the positive direction for more inclusive development.",

    "solution": {
      "explanation": "Globalization means gradual integration of economics through free movements of goods, services and capital. Globalization increased the efficiency of economy multi-dimensionally but one of the major challenges posed by globalization is the growing tendency towards flexible employment and informalisation. The reasons behind the reduction of employment due to globalisation in formal sector are following.\n\n* Increased automation in industries: Globalization exposed the technology globally which led to replacement of man power with robotics and other technology.\n* Shift from labour intensive industries to technology intensive industries: In India only 2% labour is skilled in comparison to 96% skilled labour in South Korea. Due to arrival of technology, unskilled labour was forced out from formal sector due to incapability of handling the new machines and led to informalisation.\n* Globalization encourages sub contracting of work to the informal sector because of low wage and lost cost of production in informal section. It increased the participation of contract labour in economy and reduced formal sector\u2019s employment.\n* Globalization increased competition among the industries which shifted the employment/industrial units from non-competitive countries to market favoured economics. The shifting of textile industries to the Vietnam, Laos are recent examples of this phenomenon.\n\n**Impact of informalisation on the development of the country**\n\n* Less revenue generation: Due to high informalisation, tax to GDP ratio remains very low. In case of India it is only 16.6% whereas more than 30% in OECD countries.\n* Less coverage of social security schemes: Nearly all government schemes, programmes related to social security benefits are restricted to formal sector. A huge section of population remains out of the ambit of benefits. It ultimately reduces the efficiency of economy.\n\nThis shows how informalisation of labour force has proven detrimental to the development.",

      "explanation": "Water-use efficiency refers to the ratio of water used in plant metabolism to water lost by the plant through transpiration. Water use efficiency is also about careful management of water supply sources, use of water serving technologies, reduction of excessive demand and other actions.\n\nIn context of Indian agriculture, recognizing the fast declining irrigation water potential and increasing demand for water from different sectors, a number of demand management strategies and programmes have been introduced.\n\nOne such method is micro-irrigation that includes drip irrigation and sprinkler irrigation.\n\nUnder micro-irrigation, unlike flood method of irrigation, water is supplied at a required interval and quantity using pipe network, emitters and nozzles.\n\nThe on-farm irrigation efficiency of properly designed and managed drip irrigation system is estimated to be about 90 percent, while the same is only about 35 to 40 percent for surface method of irrigation.\n\nWhile increasing the productivity of crops significantly, it also reduces weed problems, soil erosion and cost of cultivation substantially.\n\nThe reduction in water consumption in micro irrigation also reduces the energy use that is required to lift water from irrigation wells.\n\nDrip-irrigation technique can replace the hand watering system in hilly areas with minimum water losses and labour.\n\nGovernment of India has also accorded high priority to water conservation and its management. Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY) has been formulated with the vision of extending the coverage of irrigation \u2018Har Khet Ko Pani\u2019 and improving water use efficiency \u2018More crop per drop\u2019 in focused manner using sprinker & drip method of irrigation.",

Reducing red tapism experienced in form of exhaustive paper work and clearances from various departments.\n* Strict action against complaints regarding intentional blocking of entry of new NGO by a concerned authority in lieu of bribe and personal favour.\n* Recently many NGO's have faced cancellation of their registration under the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act, 2010. These cancellations have been widely criticized. The government has been charged with stalling ground level work which is carried by NGOs. In order to avert such situation transparent system for both grant providers and receivers of such funds should be created.\n* Regular appraisals of NGO by government officials must be conducted to verify the purpose, nature of work and practices followed by NGOs to ensure credibility of an NGO.\n* Trust deficit created between NGOs and the government, both questioning each other's intention must be worked out as the common man suffers the most in between as visible in the case of Saraswati.\n\nGovernment and its official through NGOs and their personnels must ensure that the policies/programs of the former reaches the downtrodden, rural as well as in remote areas so they both need to work in tandem to achieve development.",

      "explanation": "Malay Peninsula was under the British influence since they first came in the late 18th century looking towards Southeast Asia for new resources. Since then the British East India Company traded and partly controlled the region. The growth of their China trade further increased the company\u2019s desire for bases in the region near it.\n\nThe decolonization of Malaya Peninsula was an extension of the series of decolonization movements going across the Asia and Africa and was influenced from this process which speeded-up after the World War-II.\n\n* Malay Peninsula was a multi-racial, multi-cultural society with Malay Chinese and Indians forming major ethnic and interest groups which was a suitable condition for colonial powers to consolidate their regime.\n* Fall of Singapore and Japanese advances in Malay Peninsula during the World War\u2013II forced the British to consider reassessment of its non-interventionist policies in favour of ethnic cooperation and multiracial government in this region. But with the presence of diverse interest of different groups reaching to a consensus was a tough task.\n* Cold War ideological rivalry was prevalent in Malayan Peninsula too where with the rise of commintern aligned communist parties like Malayan Communist Party and Chinese Communist Organization, the fear of Malayan Peninsula falling to the Communists emerged.\u00a0 It was a nightmare for the liberal democracies/ colonial powers (i.e. British) which ensured transfer of power to ideologically friendly regimes.\n\nThe decolonization of Malayan Peninsula was largely a result of long reconciliation process between the Malayan nationalist and the European colonial powers.\u00a0 Their mutual compromise gave the British the confidence to speed up the process of decolonization through a smooth decolonization process.",

      "explanation": "India is one of the developing countries that has come out with WASH schemes to address the challenges of health and sanitation in urban and rural areas. Swachh Bharat Abhiyan for urban and rural areas is one of the manifestation of the importance of WASH schemes.\n\nThere has been huge disparities in access to WASH services across different segments of the population. In India, around 128 million lack safe water services and about 840 million people don\u2019t have sanitation services. Thus there is an urgent need to identify the different kinds of beneficiaries and communities whose accesss to WASH services need to be enhanced. The outcomes need to be enhanced in terms of adequacy, accessibility, affordability, quality and safety of the WASH services.\n\nWASH sectors come under concurrent subjects and both central and state governments can legislate on it. The collection of data related to WASH schemes are generally done at state level but it suffers from many discrepancies. The needs and barriers for segments of the population differ and consequently the strategies also need to be customised for the different segments. Therefore, policymakers are gradually moving away from a \u201cone size fits all\u201d approach to a more beneficiary-centric approach.\n\nA traditional approach has been to segment the beneficiaries on the basis of geographical and social context (GSS). Population was therefore segmented as rural, urban, low income and so on. Recently there is a trend to segment the beneficiaries on the basis of the human life cycle (LCS). Beneficiaries are thus segmented as children, adolescents, adults, senior citizens, and so on.  \nTo be able to achieve our WASH targets, it is important that our policies adopt both the LCS and GSS approaches.",

For instance, the Rashtriya Ekta Diwas celebrated on 31st October promotes unity in India.\n* Enhancing security presence along the international boundaries and seal the porous borders.\n* Undertaking policies to tackle economic and social inequalities will help in deterring disgruntled youth from being lured towards terrorism.\n* Terrorist organizations have successfully taken advantage of the great benefits of the Internet. Hence, countering radicalization on digital media must be given priority. Governments should intervene in this matter through monitoring and counter-propaganda programs\n* Incorporating \u2018SAMADHAN\u2019 in security operations in LWE affected areas and at same time focusing on development projects in Red corridor districts.\n\n**Sources of funding**\n\n* NGO, charities and donations are an important sourcing of funds for terrorism. These funds are mostly claimed through religious appeal, coercion and fears of victimization.\n* Counterfeiting of Indian currency not only funds terrorism, but, more importantly, it is used as a tool by neighboring states to destabilize the Indian economy.\n* Drug financing are also a major sources of terrorism financing in India.\n* Biggest source of internal funding for terrorist groups in India remains extortion.

      "explanation": "A tribunal is a quasi-judicial body established by an Act of Parliament or State Legislature under Article 323A or 323B to resolve disputes that are brought before it. It is not a court of law, but enjoys some of the powers of a civil court like issuing summons and allowing witnesses to give evidence.\n\n**Tribunals Curtailing Jurisdiction of Ordinary Courts**\n\n* Tribunal, being a quasi-judicial body, goes against the Doctrine of Separation of Powers and allows dilution of judicial mechanism - the exclusive arena of ordinary courts.\n* The Supreme Court (SC) in Chandra Kumar case (1997) held that the power of the High Court (HC) under Article 226 and 227 to exercise judicial superintendence over the decisions of all courts and tribunals is a part of the basic structure of the Constitution. However, decisions of some of the tribunals, like National Green Tribunal continue to be taken on appeal only before the SC bypassing the HC as Court of Appeal, depriving them of their power of judicial review.\n* Conferring a direct right of appeal to the SC from tribunals has changed the SC from a constitutional court to a mere appellate court and has also resulted in a backlog of cases.\n* Appeals from SC would require SC to deal with the finer nuances of disputes under specialised areas of law from afresh. This is not ideal for a court of last resort.\n\n**Competency of Tribunals**\n\nTribunals are dependent for appointment, tenure, funding, infrastructure and mode of removal on the Executive - the largest litigant in the country. This creates a conflict of interest situation, putting a question mark over their independence. However, tribunals play significant role in following ways:\n\n* Their administrative members can better appreciate the technical nuances of the matters brought before them and can enhance the quality of justice delivery system.\n* They have flexibility and adaptability in adjudication as they are not restrained by rigid rules of procedure.\n* They are less formal, less expensive, and a faster way to resolve disputes.\n* They also give much needed relief to ordinary courts of law, already overburdened with numerous suits.\n\n**Way forward**\n\nGiven their benefits, tribunals should be revamped keeping in mind the 272nd Law Commission report for restructuring of tribunals and the ruling of SC in Chandra Kumar Case, and bringing tribunals under independent agency. Hence, tribunals are meant to supplement ordinary courts and cannot supplant them.",

      "explanation": "The Himalayan States, including the Northeast, and the Western Ghats are the most prominent mountain ecosystems in India which are struggling to cope up with the negative impacts of development initiatives and tourism. The ***Report of Working Group II Sustainable Tourism in the Indian Himalayan Region*** by the NITI Aayog highlights similar concern.\n\nThe negative impacts emerge out of the replacement of traditional eco-friendly and aesthetic architecture with inappropriate and dangerous construction, poorly designed roads and associated infrastructure, inadequate solid waste management, air pollution, degradation of water sources, and the loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services. Their repercussions were evident in the Kedarnath floods of 2013.\n\n**In this respect, the following steps can be considered:**\n\n* The reports by committees on Western Ghats ecology headed by **Madhav Gadgil** and **K. Kasturirangan** need urgent attention. The concept of **ecological sensitive zones (ESZ)** cannot be sacrificed for the sake of development. Likewise, NITI Aayog has suggested setting up of **Himalayan Authority** for coordinated and holistic development of entire Himalayan region.\n* There has to be **clear demarcation and planning with respect to the extent of infrastructure development**. It should include a systematic process of urban planning, developing tourist hubs with strict controls, spring mapping and revival etc. For example, provision for no encroachment areas, well-preserved forested areas, etc.\n* With respect to tourism, measures like application of **carrying capacity concept** to tourist destinations, implementation and monitoring of **tourism sector standards,** and **performance-based incentives** for States faring well on the standards can be considered. The unregulated tourism movement is a major reason for plastic pollution.\n* States should also be encouraged to **spend more on sustainable development of tourism**. For instance, Uttarakhand stands second in tourist arrivals but invests only 0.15% of its total expenditure on this sector. Besides, States can also **adopt and share the best practices**. For example, Sikkim can be a lodestar for sustainable agriculture, **waste management** and **ecotourism**.\n* With collaborative and participatory frameworks **capacity building** for conservation is required. Viable enterprises that can provide sustained economic incentives and support local communities need to be promoted. These can help achieve **SDG Goal 8** (decent work and economic growth) and **Goal 12** (responsible consumption and production).\n\nTo provide a better standard of living to the mountain communities and to meet the overall needs of the economy, a linkage between development and conservation needs to be formed. Besides, effective implementation of schemes and policies hold significance for any desirable results.",

Through a notification of 1950, he has been assigned the following duties by the President:\n\n* To appear on behalf of the Government of India in the Supreme Court and high courts.\n* To represent the Government of India in any reference made by the President to the Supreme Court under Article 143 of the Constitution.\n\nAlong with these duties, the AGI also has the right of audience in all courts in the territory of India. He also enjoys all the privileges and immunities that are available to a member of Parliament.\n\nHowever, the Attorney-General is not the full-time counsel of the Government. He does not fall in the category of government servants and he is not debarred from private legal practice. But, he should not advise or hold a brief against the Government of India and he should not defend accused persons in criminal prosecutions without the permission of the Government of India.\n\nThus, the duties and privileges of the AGI, combined with the limitations imposed on him, make him the chief legal adviser and lawyer of the Government of India. Nevertheless, the separate law minister in the Central cabinet to look after legal matters at the government level, to some extent, gives the office of AGI a subordinate position.",

This has resulted in higher school dropout rates especially of girls due to lack of proper infrastructure (clean & separate toilets, distance from home) and various other household constraints.\n* Also, the investment needed in setting up schools and running them is also rising due to various factors. Moreover, the transportation of students, teachers and staff is also burdensome in some hilly states of India.\n* Digital initiatives like online lectures, online attendance, 3-D presentations, hearing and visual aid technology, etc. have changed the education world. There have been noticeable changes due to these technologies such as maximum participation of students is ensured, parents could keep real-time check on their pupil\u2019s progress, traditional student-teacher interaction could be broadened, lectures could be recorded and be seen at any time, etc. Both students and the teaching community have benefitted.\n* The lockdown phase, from March 2020 onwards, hasseen the rise of digital education on large scale. However, caution needs to be maintained and a study needs to be done to understand the negative and positive effects of digital technology on education.\n* Most importantly, asitis an emerging market with huge potential,the government needsto be in vigilant mode so that the most backward of our citizens can have access to this revolution.",

There was a deliberate delay in releasing virus-related information.\n* Delay in releasing information resulted in late actions by countries which aggravated the pandemic.\n* On the one hand, the WHO was accused of dancing to China\u2019s tunes and, on the other, there were serious questions on the powers that the WHO enjoys when it comes to taking strict action against deep funders like China.\n* Withdrawal of the USA, inadequate funds and manpower further curbed the WHO\u2019s independence and its ability to function.\n\nToday\u2019s global institutions are extremely dependent on their contributors for funding that they often become pawnsfortheir political agendas. When the US cutfunding to the WHO, China increased its contribution. However, the WHO is not a failure. Possibly, it needs restructuring.

      "explanation": "The first phase of the existence of the Congress is known as the moderate phase (1885-1905). During this, the Congress worked for limited objectives and concentrated more on building up its organisation. The leaders like Dadabhai Nauroji, P.N. Mehta, D.E. Wacha, W.C. Banerji, S.N. Banerji, Gopal Krishna Gokhale were staunch believers in liberalism and moderate politics and came to be labelled as moderates.\n\nThe main objective of the Moderates was to achieve self-government within the British Empire. They believed in patience and reconciliation rather than in violence and confrontation, thus relying on constitutional and peaceful methods in order to achieve their aims. They organised annual sessions with delegates participating from all parts of the country. After the discussions, resolutions were adopted which were forwarded to the Government for its information and appropriate action.\n\n**Success/contributions of moderates:**\n\n* They represented the most progressive forces of the time.\n* They were able to create a wide national awakening of all Indians having common interests and the need to rally around a common programme against a common enemy, and above all, the feeling of belonging to one nation.\n* They trained people in political work and popularised modern ideas.\n* They exposed the basically exploitative character of colonial rule, thus undermining its moral foundations.\n* Their political work was based on hard realities, and not on shallow sentiments, religion, etc.\n* They were able to establish the basic political truth that India should be ruled in the interest of Indians.\n* They created a solid base for a more vigorous, militant, mass-based national movement in the years that followed.\n\nThe early nationalists did a great deal to awaken the national sentiment, even though they could not draw the masses to them and failed to widen their democratic base and the scope of their demands. Moderates wanted to educate people in modern politics, to arouse national and political consciousness and to create a united public opinion on political questions. Their critics often accuse them for using methods of beggary through prayers and petitions.\n\nHowever, had they adopted revolutionary or violent methods, they would have been crushed right in the infancy of the Congress. They created a solid base for a more vigorous, militant, mass-based national movement in the following years. The Moderates thus were prudent in using the constitutional and peaceful methods to handle British rule.",

In this, a judiciary free from the orders and whims of executive and legislature is of utmost importance for retaining and practising values of the constitution.\n\n### Why judicial independence?\n\n* Separation between executive and judiciary must be maintained to relieve the courts of any political biasness that might hamper justice for anyone.\n* A court\u2019s verdict must be based solely on facts and not the perceived reality or partiality of the judge ensuring impartial judgement.\n\n### Why constitutionally backed judicial independence is important?\n\n* The judicial system works under the constitution. It is righty referred to as the guardian of the constitution, having the power as the final authority on its interpretation.\n* Unless the independence of the judiciary is constitutionally backed, it can be easily curtailed by the legislature or an executive order.\n\n**Provisions under the constitution**\n\n* Non-interference of legislature in the appointment of judges.\n* Fixed tenure of the judges.\n* Due process of impeachment for removal of a sitting judge.\n* Parliament cannot discuss the conduct of judges.\n* Charging of the salaries and allowances on the Consolidated Fund of India, thereby no need for legislative approval.\n\nThrough various provisions of the Constitution, India retains an unrestricted yet discipled judiciary that is relied on by the entire country with reverence.",

For example, certification of C++ can offer better chances of employability.\n  + Soft skills are a subset of skills that have garnered interest in the past decades and are essential today for modern job market.\n  + Skill development can also lead one not only to employment but also entrepreneurship that enables one to create jobs eventually.\n* Employment is the eventual goal of education and skill development. Employment is necessary for the growth of a nation. Employment is a necessary indicator of the health of an economy. Better employment shows higher prospects of growth for the nation.\n  + Both education and skill development train an individual adequately to help them get employed.\n  + Companies today follow a pattern of upskilling a hired person to make them better at their job.\n\nVarious skill development programmes such as Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana and National Skill Development Mission have helped the industry receive skilled workers; in other words, they have succeeded in increasing human resources supply to various sectors.",

      "explanation": "Structural unemployment is basically an involuntary unemployment that occurs because of a structural change in the economy, such as the development of a new technology or industry or due to the mismatch in skills possessed by the populations and the job available in the market.\n\nMajor reasons for structural unemployment in India include labour market rigidities, geographic mismatch, agriculture dependency, infrastructure bottlenecks, and regulatory challenges.\n\n**Methodology adopted to compute unemployment in the country**\n\n* **Computation by NSSO using:**\n  + **Current Weekly Status (CWS):** Under this, a shorter reference period of a week is adopted. Individuals are counted as employed if they have worked for at least one hour on at least one day in the preceding seven days. For example, Labour Force Participation Rate in CWS in urban areas for persons aged 15 years and above increased to 48.2 per cent in the October-December quarter of 2022.\n  + **Usual Principal and Subsidiary Status (UPSS):** It is determined based on the activity one spent the most time in the previous year.\n  + **Current Daily Status:** It indicates the number of people who did not find work for one or more days in a week.\n* **Labor Bureau Surveys:** Labor Bureau conducts survey to obtain data on unemployment and employment in India. For example, All-India Quarterly Establishment-based Employment Survey (AQEES).\n\n### Way forward\n\n* **Increase in Frequency of Surveys:** It is important to ensure timeliness and updating of the surveys as increased frequency provides better understanding of changing employment trends.\n* **Modernizing Agriculture:** Increase in investment in agriculture could have a multiplier effect through backward and forward linkages, e.g., promoting cold storages.\n* **Incorporation of Informal Sector**: More than 80 percent of the labour force is employed in informal sector which needs to be incorporated in the formal sector.\n* **Seasonal Adjustments:** Improve seasonal adjustment techniques to account for the impact of agriculture and other seasonal employment trends.\n\nTo conclude, it is high time that certain computational methodologies need to be enhanced to envisage making India as one of the largest economies and nurture the rich demographic dividends with few bottlenecks and unemployment hurdles.",

The rover aims to move around the landing site conducting experiments and sending data to the lander which in turn will send data to the orbiter that will eventually be communicated back to the earth.

The Pallava kings were great patrons of South Indian arts, architecture, and literature.\n\n### Pallavas' Contributions to Art\n\n* **Temple Architecture:** The Pallavas **introduced rock-cut temples and pioneered the Dravidian style of architecture**, evolving from cave temples to monolithic rathas, and finally to structural temples, developed in four stages.\n  + **Mahendravarman I** introduced the rock-cut temples.\n  + **Monolithic rathas and Mandapas**at Mamallapuram, credited to Narasimhavarman I. Eg, Panchapanadava rathas.\n  + Rajasimha introduced structural temples constructed from soft sandstone. E.g., Kailasanatha temple at Kanchi.\n  + Structural temples built by the later Pallavas. Eg, Vaikundaperumal temple.\n* **Sculpture:** The Pallavas significantly advanced sculpture like Open Art Gallery at Mamallapuram and Descent of the Ganges.\n* The Paintings at the caves of Sittannavasal belonged to them.\n\n![](TEST_IMAGES/UPSC_MAIN_CSE_GS_2024_PAPER_1_Q2_IMG_1.png)\n\n### Pallavas' Contributions to Literature\n\n* Pallava kings Mahendravarman I as a patrons of **Sanskrit literature authored the play \"Mattavilasa Prah****asana\u201d****.**\n* **Tamil Literature** flourished with contributions from the Nayanmars and Alwars.\n* **Perundevanar** translated the Mahabharata into Tamil as *Bharathavenba* under Nandivarman II.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe Pallavas of Kanchi laid a rich cultural legacy through their contributions to architecture, sculpture, and literature. Their innovations in temple architecture and patronage of literature not only influenced South Indian art but also had a lasting impact on Indian cultural history.",

They can occur globally but are most common in the Gulf of Mexico region.\n\n### Body:\n\n**Factors that lead to frequent occurrence of Twisters in Gulf of Mexico:**\n\n* **Warm, Moist Air:** The Gulf of Mexico supplies warm, moist air that rises, creating conditions for thunderstorms.\n* **Cold, Dry Air:** Cold, dry air from the Rocky Mountains or Canada moves south, clashing with warm, moist air and causing atmospheric instability.\n* **Wind Shear:** Variations in wind speed and direction at different altitudes create wind shear, leading to a horizontal spinning effect essential for tornado formation.\n* **Geographical Features:** The flat terrain of the Great Plains and Mississippi River Valley heats quickly, providing ideal conditions for tornadoes.\n* **Tropical Storms and Hurricanes:** The Gulf is prone to tropical storms and hurricanes that can spawn tornadoes upon landfall.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThus twisters, or tornadoes, are destructive windstorms formed by rotating columns of air. The Gulf of Mexico region experiences frequent tornadoes due to the collision of warm, moist air with cold, dry air, along with favorable geography and seasonal patterns.",
