      "explanation": "Krishnadeva Raya who ruled the kingdom of Vijayanagara was one of the greatest statesmen which medieval South India had produced. Called variously as \u2018Kannadaraya\u2019, \u2018Sri Karnata Mahisa\u2019 and \u2018Kannada Rajya Ramaramana\u2019, his rule saw all round prosperity of South India, culturally and materialistically.\n\nKrishnadeva Raya was a great patron of literature and was known as Abhinava Bhoja. Himself being a scholar, he wrote the Telugu work *Amuktamalyada* and a Sanskrit play, *Jambavati Kalyana*.\n\n* He had eight great scholars called Ashtadiggajas in his court. They included Allasani Peddana often described as the Andhra-kavitapitamaha. His famous work was *Manucharitamu;* another famous poet was Nandi Thimmanna, the author of *Parijathapaharanamu*.\n* Other eminent literary luminaries were Tenali Ramakrishna, Kumara Dhurjati and Rama Raja Bhushana.\n* He asked the Kannada poet Thimmanna to complete the Kannada Mahabharatha started by Kumara Vyasa.\n* Telugu poet Peddanna was personally honoured by him for his proficiency in Telugu and Sanskrit and Krishnadevaraya himself gave a helping hand to lift the palanquin in which the poets book *'Manucharitamu'* was placd and taken in a procession.\n\nIt is said whenever Krishna-devaraya met the poet while riding on his elephant, he gave him a lift. According to Nidatavolu Venkata Rao, the reign of Krishnadevaraya is a glorious chapter in the South Indian literary history. The imperial court had representatives of Sanskrit, Telugu, Kannada and Tamil poets, who contributed largely to their respective literatures.",

      "explanation": "Mahatma Gandhi and Subhash Chandra Bose were both legendary personalities, gigantic in their political moral and ethical stature. Both played crucial roles in the freedom movement. They were both internationalists and humanists as well as secular in their approach and anti-social in their outlook. In spite of their common thought process, there were glaring differences in their approach. They are as follows:\n\n* Subhash Chandra Bose was a radical socialist meaning that he wanted to change the existing socio-economic situation whereas Gandhi was a conservative.\n* The young members, of INC including Bose demanded complete self-rule without any compromise while the senior members were okay with dominion status for India within British rule.\n* Bose had a strong revolutionary urge to achieve freedom while Gandhi believed in passive resistance.\n* Bose proposed the idea of complete Independence from the British rule. He wanted Swaraj based on all out struggle. Gandhi on the other hand believed in the concept of Struggle-Truce-Struggle. Gandhi was in favour of trusteeship theory and aspired village to be self-sustained economy.\n* Bose was a strong supporter of Fascism which was obvious in his strong belief that India needed a political system which was a mix of fascism and communism. Gandhi on the other hand was an anti fascist who did not propagate any such extreme political system.\n* Bose was open to the idea of taking foreign assistance to achieve freedom as seen in the formation of Indian national Association while Gandhi was completely against any such idea.\n\nDespite their ideological defferences both Gandhi and Bose spoke highly of each other. There were occasions when Bose praised Gandhi for his success in involvement of women in freedom struggle. Even Gandhi while differing from Bose\u2019s extreme methods had utmost admiration for his unique effort for India\u2019s freedom, mainly his struggle for freedom from outside India. Cue must be taken from these two great leaders\u2019 tolerance and respect towards each other even after serious difference of opinion.",

      "explanation": "Allelopathy is a biological phenomenon in which plants release chemical poisons to destroy neighbouring plants in their bid for more space and sunlight. The poison released are deadly, they change the very genetic structure of the victim plants preventing its growth and ultimately leading to its death.\n\n* **In sustainable wild management:** Allelopathic applications such as Straw mulching provide sustainable weed management. It also helps in reducing negative impact of environment on agriculture. Straw mulch can improve the organic matter in the soil and increase its fertility. Allelo chemicals are called \u2018Natural herbicides\u2019.\n* **In reduction of Nitrogen leaching and Environment pollution:** Nitrogen leaching is a severe ecological problem due to water pollution. In recent years studies have proven that Nitrification Inhibiting Substance (NIS) produced by plants can reduce the emission of N2O, improve the utilization rate of nitrogen fertilizer and reduce pollution to the environment.\n* **Plant-animal/insect interactions:** Allelo chemicals may variously act as feeding attractants or repellents, have hormonal effects on the insects or provide the insects with a useful defense mechanism against predation.\n* Many border plants are used in this manner around fields and gardens to keep undesired animals away.\n\nStudies on allelopathy in crops and weeds have been developed in the past few decades and the use of allelopathic crops in crop rotation, cover crops, green manure, inter cropping etc has become a reality.",

      "explanation": "The first half of the eighteenth century witnessed decline and disintegration of the mighty Mughal Empire and rise of virtually independent regional powers.

Courtrooms became kingmaker\u2019s ground for treachery and war of succession became recurrent.\n* A number of powerful kingdoms such as Bengal, Avadh, Hyderabad and Mysore arose and became virtually independent from the Mughal Empire.\n* The weakened Mughal Empire was challenged by Marathas time and again. Marathas captured vast swathes of territory in northern and central India.\n* The remaining illusion of continued domination of Mughal power was shattered by Nadir Shah\u2019s (Shah of Persia) invasion of India in 1739.\n* Afghan ruler Ahmad Shah Abdali also made frequent inroads into Punjab and finally took over Delhi in 1756-57. Marathas, who were considered as only contender to fill the power vacuum in Delhi, were defeated by Abdali's forces in the Third Battle of Panipat (1761). The war didn\u2019t decide who will rule India but who would not.\n\nAfter these series of events, the Mughal Empire ceased to exist as an all-India empire in practice. The British took advantage of the entire situation. They defeated the forces of Bengal in Battle of Plassey and finally combined forces of Bengal, Awadh and Mughal were crushed in Battle of Buxar.",

Constitutional reforms, administrative re-organisation and protection of civil rights were high on agenda and methods of prayers, petition and protest were followed.\n\nModerates met limited success in later stages due to various reasons\u2013\n\n* The political jargons used by the moderates were alien to uneducated masses. There was also lack of political faith in the masses. Thus people largely remained aloof.\n* It was gradually realised that the British didn\u2019t concede to any of the major demands of the moderates.\n* Indian Council Act 1892 was criticised. Moves such as further amplification of repressive laws under IPC and reduction in number of members in Calcutta Corporation didn\u2019t go down well with progressive elements in INC.\n* Political ideologies of the moderates were blamed to be inefficient. Methods followed by moderates were described as political mendicancy. The result was emergence of a more militant school of thought.\n\nHowever, the role of moderates can also not be negated. They were first to create national awakening among Indians and prepared a solid ground for mass oriented national movement at later stages that followed.",

Though the government reorganized various states and also formed new states but cultural units have been intact in India till this day.\n\n* Recently Chhath parv has been celebrated in Purvanchal region, which comprises the eastern end of Uttar Pradesh and western end of Bihar, where Hindi-Urdu and its dialects Awadhi and Bhojpuri are the predominant language.\n* Population living in green revolution area that comprises Punjab, Haryana and west Uttar Pradesh practices nearly same traditions and represents a single cultural unit.\n* Influence of Dravidian culture can be seen across all South Indian states, food habit of people living in these states is similar, wedding rituals are same.\n* North eastern region comprising 8 states represents as a single cultural unit in terms of their traditions.\n* Rice fish culture has also been practiced across all coastal regions in different states.\n\nIt shows that cultural units in India are not necessarily concurrent with states and beyond the boundaries of formal division of states.",

In these years, Indian national movement transformed from the movement of few middle class elites, to a mass movement.\n* The objectives of Independence became Swaraj and Sarvodaya where the fruit of independence was to be tasted by the last man standing in the row and not mere the transfer of power from one set of white elites to another Indian elites.\n* After twenties the goal of political independence was gradually broadened by the constructive programmes where the issues of untouchability and Hindu- Muslim unity were also considered as important goals.\n* Fundamental Rights and Economic Policy was shaped during Karachi resolution of 1931.\n\nHence the vision of Indian independence was broadened in scale and scope after the twenties of last century.",

Gandhian ideal of social consciousness to eliminate it needs to be taken forward. |\n| Women Emancipation | With glass-ceiling still far from being shattered in the public sphere, the Gandhian thought of women emancipation continues to hold relevance. |\n\nGandhian thoughts about compassion, punctuality and sanitation are the other ideals that continue to hold value in our times marked by strife, procrastination in public and private lives and casual attitude towards hygiene.\n\nUltimately, all ideals and thoughts of the Mahatma were reached by him via a process of life long experimentation with truths and this makes Gandhian thoughts most significant in what is also being called by a few as post-truth era.",

      "explanation": "Indian social set-up during the medieval period was based on Brahmanism characterized by rigid caste division, rituals and methods of prayer. Bhakti Movement was a reformative movement characterized by intense devotion or love for God. The movement focused to reform Indian society which was shadowed by Brahmanical dominance.\n\nBhakti Movement started from South India in the form of Vaishnavite and Shaivaite sect, commonly known as Alvars and Nayanars respectively. Early 16th century was marked by rise of Bhakti Saint Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu in Eastern India. He was a Vaishanavit Saint and an ardent follower of Lord Krishna. According to his followers, he was an incarnation of Lord Krishna.\n\nChaitnaya Mahaprabhu preached love, compassion, and non-violence. Though he was a Brahmin, he condemned caste system and emphasized on equality for all. According to him true worship lay in love and devotion. Bhakti Movement is known to transcend the practice of strict rituals and religious practices. Chaitanya Mahaprabhu is known to have revolutionized and re-oriented Bhakti Movement, giving it impetus through simplicity in teachings, propagating Bhakti ideas through his disciples, instructing them to write books, and overall making it a mass movement\n\nThe very first mandate by Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu to his disciples was to go to each house and ask people to chant \u2018Hari Bol\u2019. By this, he propagated amongst people the practice of \u2018Nama Simaran\u2019 as a mode of devotion and love for God. Further, he propagated his message of \u2018Hari Bol\u2019 through \u2018Sankirtan Mandali\u2019. In these Mandalies, devotees used to chant, sing and dance. Through Sankirtan, chanting of Hari Bol and combined dance and chant, Mahaprabhu brought people from different caste, creed, religion and sex together.\n\nThe message of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu or Gaudiya School of thought is now propagated through ISKCON Movement across the world. It has participation of devotees from around the world. In other words it can be said that Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu not only revolutionized Bhakti movement but also universalized it.",

Thus, British exploited both the vulnerability and readily available large population.\n\nOnce placed in British colonies, festivals such as Muharram, Holi served as a placental link to preserve their cultural Identity.\n\n* In Trinidad, the annual Muharram procession was transformed in to carnival \u2018Hosay\u2019 for Imam Hossain drawing a large crowd.\n* The protest religion of RASTAFARIANISM popularized by Bob Marley reflects social and cultural links with Indian migrants to Carribean.\n* Chutney music became popular in Trinidad.\n* Bollywood kept alive the cultural identity among indentured labor.\n* A rigid caste system of Indian society melted as indentured people identified more with \u2018Indianness\u2019, promoting fraternal feeling.\n* Initiatives such as \u2019Know India Programme\u2019 are conscious efforts by Government of India to ensure a continuum of new generations with Indian ethos.\n\nHowever, the Sri Lankan 13th Amendment to constitution is reminder that the quest to preserve their culture continues in some places. By and large, indentured labour have been able to retain their cultural heritage and renew their links with India both as potent act of resistance and a powerful affirmation of their distinctness.",

It is not possible to think clearly and make the right decisions if one is angry or intolerant.\n\nAnger makes a person lose calmness and forces them to take hasty decisions which may not be correct. Anger makes a person to lose patience which drives him towards intolerance. Angry person is a constantly stressed person; such a person cannot think with clarity.\n\nBalanced decision making, social progress and development is made possible through leaders who have a cool head on their shoulders and not by people who are easily irritated or who are not tolerant of others, conflicting viewpoints, ways of living and thinking or world views.\n\nToday, it is common to find people and leaders losing steadiness of mind when faced with stress. Angry and intolerant people are often bad decision makers. The World Wars and other wars in history were often fomented by people who easily grew angry and intolerant (such as Hitler who is responsible for millions of murders).\n\nCorrect understanding of a situation requires mental composure and equanimity. Angry and intolerant people cannot differentiate between correct and incorrect understanding.",

Bayly** brings to our notice what **Eric Stokes** has written in his book \u2018The peasant armed: the Indian Revolt of 1857\u2019.\n* During the first century of British rule, there were a series of uprisings which **Kathleen Gough** has called **\u201crestorative rebellions\u2019\u2019** as they were started by disaffected local rulers, Mughal officials or dispossessed zamindars.\n* The century before 1857 witnessed more than 40 major rebellions apart from hundreds of minor ones. However, these were local in character and effects & isolated from each other because each rebellion had a different motive.\n\n### Peasant Uprisings\n\n* **The Faqir and Sanyasi Rebellions, Bengal & Bihar (1770-1820s):** These were widely recurrent confrontations with almost 50,000 participants involved at the height of insurgency.\n* **The Revolt of Raja Chait Singh, Awadh (1778-81):** Primary goal was to restore the existing agrarian relations and it kept recurring till 1830s.\n* **Polygar Rebellions, Andhra Pradesh (1799-1805):** Polygars (feudal lords appointed as military chiefs) were joined by peasants against Company\u2019s tactics and the rebellion reached a big scale before it was oppressed.\n* **Paika Rebellion, Odisha (1817):** An armed rebellion under the leadership of Bakshi Jagabandhu against the Company\u2019s rule.\n* **Fairazi Movement, Eastern Bengal (1838-1848):** First ever no-tax campaign led by Shariatullah Khan and Dadu Mian. It was local in nature and kept on recurring till 1870s.\n\n### Tribal Uprisings\n\n* **Bhil Uprisings, Khandesh (present day Maharashtra & Gujarat), (1818-31):** Bhils rebelled against the British occupation of Khandesh but were crushed in 1819 but the situation remained unsettled till 1831.\n* **Kol Uprising, Chhota Nagpur & Singhbhum region, Bihar & Orissa (1831-32):** Plunder and arson were the chief mode with negligible killings but had a major impact in the region.\n* **Santhal Uprising, Eastern India (1855-56):** The most effective tribal movement which spread rapidly covering areas of Bihar, Orissa and Bengal against British infiltrating policies.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe century long economic exploitation, political subjugation, discriminatory policies, religious interference and suppression of uprisings finally culminated in the revolt of 1857 giving a platform to the discontented leaders of the earlier rebellions to raise voices against the Company.",

Since ancient times, India has accommodated different elements of society without letting them lose their separate identityas Jawahar Lal Nehru writes in *The Discovery of India-*Indian Society and Culture \u201c*is like some ancient palimpsest on which layer upon layer of thought and reverie* had been inscribed, and yet no succeeding layer had completely hidden or erased what had been written previously\u201d.\n\n* In course of time, India has evolved its own culture which is *eclectic,externally receptive and heterogeneous*.\n* The essence of Indian society lies in harbouring diverse and distinct identities, ethnicities, languages, religions and culinary preferences. History stands witness to the fact that the societies that have struggled to hold differences were shattered in such an attempt.\n\n**However, Indian society succeeded and is unique because of its various peculiarities:**\n\n* **A Cosmic Vision:** The framework of Indian culture places human beings in the centre of the universe, as a divine creation-which celebrates Individuality and differences of opinion in the society.\n* **Sense of Harmony:** Indian philosophy and culture tries to achieve an innate harmony and order in the society.\n* **Tolerance:** In India, tolerance and liberalism is found for all religions, castes, communities, etc. Indian society accepted and respected Shaka, Huna, Scythians , Muslim, Christian,jews and Zoroastrians. Rulers like Ashoka, Akbar have patronized various religions and ensured that there is peaceful co-existence of religions.\n* **Continuity and Stability:**The light of ancient Indian culture life is yet glowing. Many invasions occurred, many rulers changed, many laws were passed but even today, the traditional institutions, religion, epics, literature, philosophy, traditions, etc. are alive.\n* **Adaptability:** Adaptability is the process of changing according to time, place and period. Indian society has shown fluidity and has adjusted itself with changing times.\n* **Caste System and Hierarchy:** Indian Society has evolved systems of social stratification, which in the past helped in accommodating outsiders,but concomitantly it has also been the reason for descrimination and prejudice.\n* **Unity in diversity:** Despite inherent difference Indian society celebrates unity in diversity which reflects in modern India\u2019s founding principles and constitutional ideals.\n\nIn recent times,Indian society has seen surge on multiple divisive issues like communalism,casteism,economic disparity and ethnic violence,which pose a serious challenge to the time- tested ethos of our society.\n\nDespite this,India remains a diverse country, a bewildering mosaic of communities of all kinds; our peculiar societal genius is to fashion a form of coexistence where diversity can flourish and find its place. Principle of Sarva Dharma Sambhava (equal respect for all religions) is rooted in India\u2019s tradition and culture.",

The oldest civilisation has had ample time and experiences to accumulate the cultural practises of everyone who came here with their respective motives whether it was tourism, education, plunder, exploitation or to rule.\n\n* Vast resources attracted people and foreign rulers in our past and they keep attracting people in the present as well. People from smaller cities migrate to urban centres and metropolitan areas in search of employment, education etc and they eventually settle down there. When such diversity of people pools in together at a relatively smaller place, it becomes a cultural pocket.\n* **The basic idea is that within a bigger, overarching culture, another smaller and different culture is developed and sustained.** The **metropolitan areas** like National Capital Region of Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Bengaluru or **coastal industrial hubs** like Surat, Kochi, Visakhapatnam or **religious centres** like Ajmer, Amarnath, Chardhams etc can be taken as examples of hubs of such cultural pockets within India.\n* **Metropolitan areas** represent a culture of their own which is entirely different from each other and can be seen in the banter between Delhi and Mumbai. But they are well diverse within themselves as well depending upon the time and place. The **Ganpati Utsav** and those who celebrate it, form a cultural pocket within Mumbai for ten days. It applies to other places as well. In Delhi, a cultural pocket is formed by the political, defence personnel and the patriotic citizens around the **Independence Day** celebrations.\n* **Multi Storey housing societies** in urban areas are also an example of cultural pockets. Diverse people live in the same building exchanging food habits, traditions, indegenous culture and they celebrate all festivals together as if they are a big joint family. Same applies to **multinational organisations and corporate offices** as well where workers represent the diversity of India.\n* **Higher educational institutes like universities and colleges** provide us with the same scenario. Students from every corner of the nation irrespective of their hometowns, race, caste, class or any other differences sit and study in the same classroom and take part in extracurricular activities and college festivals together.\n* It is very clear to us that India has uncountable cultural pockets all over the nation with different set of values and outlooks towards life enriching Indian cultural heritage and validating the fact that **India is indeed one of the Cultural Superpowers** of the world.",

After independence, India did not have enough to feed its burgeoning population and it was forced to subsist on *\"ship to mouth\"* existence.\n\nAt these junctures,two personalities-Sir M Visvesvaraya and MS Swaminathan- emerged who revolutionised their respective fields of knowledge, contributing enormously to India\u2019s development.\n\n### Sir M. Visvesvaraya\u2019s contribution in the field of water engineering\n\n* He is remembered as India\u2019s most prolific civil engineer, dam builder, economist, statesman, and can be counted among the last century\u2019s foremost nation-builders.\n* He played an instrumental role in the construction of the Krishna Raja Sagara Lake and dam in 1924. This dam not only became the main source of water for irrigation for the nearby areas, but is also the main source of drinking water for several cities.\n* Visvesvaraya was, among other things, responsible for the building and consolidation of dams across the country. He invented the Block System -automated doors that close in the conditions of overflow, and also designed Hyderabad\u2019s flood management system.\n* He is recognised for his brilliance and creativity in harnessing water resources, designing and constructing dams and bridges, and revolutionising the irrigation system in India.\n* Due to his outstanding contribution to the society, Government of India conferred \u2018Bharat Ratna\u2019 on this legend in the year 1955.\n\n### Dr. M.S. Swaminathan\u2019s contribution to agriculture science\n\n* A plant geneticist by training, Professor Swaminathan\u2019s contributions to the agricultural renaissance of India have led to his being widely referred to as the scientific leader of the green revolution movement.\n* Recognized worldwide for his basic and applied research in genetics, cytogenetics, radiation and chemical mutagenesis, food and biodiversity conservation, he conceptualized *ever-green revolution* movement in agriculture.\n* Swaminathan is the visionary who took India from the bondage of \u2018Ship to Mouth\u2019 existence to the freedom of *\u2018Right to Food\u2019* through home grown food.\n* Apart from serving as head of various national and international institutions, he headed the **National Commission on Farmers (NCF)** constituted in 2004 to address the nationwide calamity of farmer suicides in India.\n\nIndia needs to adhere to the visions of these two men, especially when our agrarian challenges are mounting due to erratic rainfall, cycles of floods and droughts, unsustainable practices and other endemic issues.",

      "explanation": "Traditional medicine comprises medical aspects of Traditional Knowledge (TKs) that developed over generations within various societies before the era of modern medicine. India has diverse set of traditional practices arising out of Ayurveda, Siddha, and diverse Tribal Practices that have developed over generations.\n\n### Issues involved in the protection of Traditional Knowledge\n\n* **Non-codification of TKs:** Non-codified traditional knowledge are vulnerable to lose their relevance with the influences of modern medical practices.\n* **Patenting of TKs by Biotechnology companies:** Various cases of Bio-piracy were raised in India where Biotech companies used the Traditional Knowledge to develop products and issued patents. E.g. Jeevani sports drug was derived from traditional knowledge of Kani tribe.\n* **Access and Benefit Sharing from TKs:** Traditional knowledge is also often held collectively by communities, rather than by individual owners. This makes the benefit sharing difficult.\n* **Inadequate International Regimes for protection of TKs:** Due to the community nature of traditional knowledge, it is not recognized in international laws explicitly.\n\n### Steps of Government To Protect TKs\n\n* **Legal Steps:**\n  + **Biological Diversity Act:** It contains the provision for fair and equitable sharing of the benefits arising out of the utilization of genetic resources.\n  + **Forest Rights Act 2006:** It provides for community rights over forest resources. It can help in the protection of traditionally owned knowledge and practices. It also protects and promotes the livelihood of tribal community which is often based on their knowledge system and forest produce.\n  + **The Geographical Indication of Goods (Registration and Protection) Act, 1999:** It provides a collective right to the holders of the traditional knowledge associated with a particular geographical area.\n* **Institutional Steps:**\n  + **AYUSH Ministry:** To cultivate education and research in Ayurveda, Yoga, Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha, Homoeopathy, Sowa-Rigpa (Traditional Tibetan medicine), and other indigenous medicine systems.\n\n### Policy Measures, Initiatives and Projects\n\n* **Traditional Knowledge Digital Library (TKDL):** It is a repository of traditional knowledge, especially of medicinal plants and formulations used in Indian system of medicine.\n* **National Ayush Mission:** It promotes AYUSH medical practices, quality enhancement and mainstreaming these practices to our healthcare system. It also promotes the education and awareness of AYUSH medicine system.\n* **Research Centres and National Institutes** have been created across India in the fields of Ayurveda, Unani, Homoeopathy, Siddha.\n* **India has also signed agreements** with the United Kingdom Intellectual Property Office and other countries\u2019 patent office like USA etc to prevent the grant of invalid patents by giving patent examiners at International Patent Offices access to the TKDL database for patent search and examination.\n\nThe interest in traditional medicines is growing rapidly due to the increased side effects, adverse drug reactions, and cost factor of modern medicines. So, awareness and development of various traditional knowledge practices should be done along with a focus on their mainstreaming so as to reap its potential of great livelihood support particularly for the tribals. Also, a sui-generis system should be developed that can recognize the diverse nature of Traditional Knowledge and provide them with adequate legal and commercial protection.",

      "explanation": "Actions of a person are largely determined by her thought process. One\u2019s thoughts are the first engagement points with the society. Thoughts impact behaviour as well as the attitude, while moulding the actions. It therefore, becomes very important for the thoughts to be fixated to a compass of morality and conscience. Ethical behaviour and regulation of actions emerge from ethical thought process.\n\nThoughts or reflections on experiences open up possibilities for the choices of action to be taken. An understanding and awareness of one\u2019s thoughts and feelings, or emotional intelligence can help in regulating her actions accordingly. For example, while thoughts of kindness and compassion can create more empathetic individuals, thoughts of violence and anger can contribute to the making of criminals in society.\n\nTechnological advancements like Artificial Intelligence and Big data invoke new questions around ethics in the present day society. Individuals\u2019 thinking has become more self centred under the impact of increasing individualism and consumerism, this has further led to the individuals\u2019 detachment from the community and society. There has also been an increased desire from the market and the state for the control over people\u2019s thoughts, behaviours and actions. This is not only in violation of a person\u2019s right to speech and expression but also reduces the individual\u2019s tendency to question and to think critically.\n\nIt is in these times that people\u2019s ability to think freely in a society should be nurtured. Societies need to emphasise more on the education as inculcation of critical ethical thinking can produce individuals who act ethically, thereby impacting society, nation and the world at large.",

      "explanation": "Rock-cut architecture is the art of moulding a structure by chiselling it out of solid natural rock. Some conspicuous rock-cut structures of ancient India include Chaityas, Viharas, temples, etc.\n\n### Rock-cut architectures: Emblem of Indian art\n\n* The Mesolithic period saw the first use and modifications. The overhanging rocks of natural caves were embellished with petroglyphs or rock-cut designs. Example: Bhimbetka.\n* In the 3rd century BCE, rock-cut caves were constructed by the Mauryans for the Avijika and Jain ascetics in the Barabar and Nagarjuni hills of Bihar. The caves are known for the bow-shaped arches.\n* The Gupta and Vakataka period (3rd century CE - 6th century CE) was perhaps the golden age for rock-cut architecture. During this period, the designs of rock-cut architectures became more elaborate and aesthetics more pronounced. A profuse variety of decorative sculpture, intricately carved columns and carved reliefs mark the rock-cut architecture of the period. Example: Ajanta Caves.\n* The Pallava architects started the carving of rock for the creation of monolithic copies of structural temples. Example: Panch Ratha of Mamallapuram, the five structures shaped as rathas or chariots chiselled out of a large block of stone of granite dates back to the 7th century.\n* The Kailash temple, constructed by Rashtrakutas at Ellora, provides a singular example, excavated from the top down rather than by the usual practice of carving into the scarp of a hillside.\n\n### Historical significance\n\n* The rock-cut architectures are mostly religious but also reflect an important connection between religion, commerce, and society. The stories represented on the cave walls or through sculptures are valuable sources of historical information.\n* Buddhist monks created their cave hermitages near trade routes. The Buddhist missionaries employed the caves as shrines and shelters conforming to the religious concepts of asceticism. Traders often travelled the trade routes in the company of the Buddhist missionaries.\n* The architecture also reflects the changing realities of the subcontinent. The themes of rock-cut architectures changed as Buddhism weakened in the face of a renewed Hinduism during the 6th-8th century CE.\n* The Buddhiststories were replaced by Hindu Gods and mythologies. Many cave temples, developed under the patronisation of southern Indian Hindu kings were dedicated to Hindu gods and goddesses.\n\nRock-cut architectures occupy a very important place in Indian history. Their significance has been rightly underlined as many rock-cutstructures have been incorporated in the UNESCO world heritage list. Example: Ajanta caves, Group of Monuments at Mahabalipuram, etc.",

      "explanation": "Indian philosophy refers to philosophical traditions which developed in the Indian subcontinent. It generally includes Hindu, Buddhist and Jain Philosophy, among others.\n\nArt is one of the cultural activities of man through which he reaches his ideas, values, feelings, aspirations and reactions to life. Hence the influence of philosophy on monuments and their art is inextricable.\n\nThe Monuments and their arts, from Asoka\u2019s Pillars to Chola\u2019s Brihadeshwara temple have been influenced by the contemporary and prominent philosophy and traditions. The early monuments have been dominated by Buddhism and Jainism while Hinduism began to influence from the Gupta period.\n\n* The Asokan Pillar, the Stupas have been influenced by the Buddhist philosophies depicting teachings, stories, symbols associated with Buddhism. The Chakra of Sarnath\u2019s pillar symbolises Dharmachakrapravartana and the Chattra of stupas embodies the Three Jewels of Buddhism.\n* The ascetics belonging to Ajivika, Jainism, Buddhism required places for meditation. Rock-cut caves like Lomas Rishi, Ajanta or Ellora were carved out to provide a place of solitude for the monks and sages.\n* Engravings, paintings, or sculptures of theses caves depict the teachings of these philosophies. For example, the ceilings of Ajanta caves have paintings showing the life cycles of Buddha, Ellora caves contain images of 24 Jinas.\n* The works at the Jain temples include, in addition to the Jinas, carvings of gods and goddesses, yaksa, yakshi and human devotees. The cells of Jain viharas are small and plain, designed to observe rigorous asceticism by Jain monks.\n* From the Gupta period onwards, Hindu temple architecture began to evolve. Constructed mainly in three distinctive styles, Nagara, Vesara, and Dravida, the architecture and walls of Hindu temples are influenced and embellished with sculptures influenced from Hindu epics and mythologies.\n* The Khajuraho temple\u2019s territory is laid out in three triangles that converge to form a pentagon to reflects the Hindu symbolism for three realms or trilokinatha, and five cosmic substances or panchbhuteshvara.\n* The Monolithic temples like Kailasha (8th century CE) at Ellora or Group of monuments at Mamallapuram (7th\u20138th century CE) have beep influenced by Hindu religion and mythology, telling stories from Shivapurana, Mahabharata, etc.\n\nThe Indian philosophy and traditions have been a predominant factorinfluencing the architecture and interiors of the monuments. But, the monuments were not solely shaped by philosophies and they have incorporated activities such as trade or cultural interaction.",

He formed 1,200 gardens in the vicinity of Dehli.\n* **Khawaja Najm-ud-Din Hasan** wrote **Fawaid-ul-Faud** which records a conversation with the great saint Nizamud-Din Aulia.\n  + This work is considered a valuable document on Sufi philosophy because it containsthe discourses of Nizamud-Din Aulia in chronological order.\n* **Abu\u2019l Fazl** is credited with writing **Akbarnama** and **Ain-i-Akbari**, the masterpieces depicting the Mughal era.\n  + Akbarnama is embedded with miniature paintings. Itis an importantsource to study Mughalstyle paintings. For example: \u201cEmperor Akbar on Elephant Hunt\u201d and \u201cRan Bagha crossing the River Jumna\u201d. Paintings are also a source to understand the prevalent dress and fashion style.\n  + Akbarnama and Ain-i-Akbari provide a holistic picture of the policies adopted by Akbar for religious and social tolerance.

He also translated Bhagavad Gita into the Persian language.\n\nWith the coming of the Muslimsto the subcontinent, Persian, an Aryan tongue and sister language of Sanskrit, came to India, which isthe confluence of diverse faiths, languages and cultures and which has a tradition of adopting and blending and then producing a composite cultural unity in diversity.",

      "explanation": "Originally began in South India in the 9th century with Shankaracharya, the Bhakti Literature spread over all parts of India and by the 16th century and became a great spiritual force to reckon with, especially after the great wave made by Kabir, Nanak and Shri Chaitanya.\n\n**Nature of Bhakti Literature:**\n\n* Bhakti and Sufi supported each other. Various recitation of sufi saints found place in Sikhs\u2019 religious canons.\n* Spread of Bhakti cult due to adoption of vernacular languages which was easy to be understood by masses.\n* It preached for removal of sectarianism and casteism. The Bhakti literature called for inclusion of castes and out-castes.\n\n**Contribution of Bhakti Literature:**\n\n* The Bhakti literature promoted the growth of vernacular language in different parts of the country.\n  + Bengali was used by Chaitanya and by the poet Chandidas, who wrote extensively on the theme of the love of Radha and Krishna.\n  + Shankaradeva popularised the use of the Assamese in the Brahmaputra valley in the 15th He used an entirely new medium to spread his ideas.\n  + Marathi reached its apogee at the hands of saints like Eknath and Tukaram.\n  + Other prominent saints like Kabir, Nanak, and Tulsidas contributed enormously to regional literature and language with their captivating verses and spiritual exposition.\n* Emergence of a new cultural tradition with the influence of Bhakti and sufism. Also emergence of new sects like Sikhism, Kabir panth etc.\n* Post-Vedanta ideas were explored by Madhvacharya through his Dvaitadvaita, by Ramanujacharya in his Vishishta Advaita etc.\n* As a literary movement, it liberated poetry from singing the praises of kings and introduced spiritual themes. From a style point of view, it introduced simple and accessible styles like vachanas (in Kannada), saakhis, dohas and other forms in various languages and ended the hegemony of Sanskrit metrical forms.\n\nThe ideas of Bhakti Movement continued to permeate the cultural ethos of the society through the enormous body of literature left by them.

This led to the development of new Indian middle-class intelligentsia, where people like Raja Ram Mohan Roy, Ishwar Chand Vidyasagar, Dayanand Saraswati, etc. spread the ideals of liberty, social and economic equality, democracy and justice.\n\n**Brahmo Samaj and Raja Ram Mohan Roy:**\n\n* Raja Ram Mohan Roy is known as the father of Modern India\u2019s Renaissance and a tireless social reformer who inaugurated the age of enlightenment and liberal reformist modernisation in India.\n* He founded Brahmo Sabha in 1828, whose main aim was the worship of the eternal God. However, it was against priesthood, rituals and sacrifices.\n* The greatest achievement in the field of social reform was the abolition of Sati in 1829.\n* He advocated the abolition of polygamy and wanted women to be educated and given the right to inherit property.\n* This led to the emergence of rationalism and enlightenment in India which indirectly contributed to the nationalist movement.\n* It was the forerunner of all social, religious and political movements of modern India.\n\n**Young Bengal and Henry Lui Vivian Derozio:**\n\n* Derozio joined the Hindu College of Calcutta as a teacher.\n* He promoted radical ideas through his teaching and by organising an association for debate and discussions on literature, philosophy, history and science.\n* He inspired his followers and students to question all authority.\n* Derozio and his famous followers, known as Young Bengal, were fiery patriots.\n* They cherished the ideals of the French Revolution (1789) and the liberal thinking of Britain.\n\nApart from attacking social evils like bigotry, superstition, untouchability, purdah system, sati, child marriage, social inequalities and illiteracy, the social and religious reform movements also helped in dealing with the racism perpetuated by the colonial rule.

Therefore, they believe in producing generalists. But in the mainstream society, knowledge and learning has been disintegrated into specialised subjects and these societies mainly focus on producing specialists.\n* **Equality**: Tribal knowledge systems are non-exclusionary and marked by equity.

      "explanation": "Gandhi\u2019s comprehensive plan of national regeneration, which he named the constructive programme, aimed at establishing social order, based on truth and non-violence. Gandhi believed that foreign domination in India lived and prospered because of our negligence towards fundamental duties as a nation. Collective fulfilment of these duties can be referred to as the constructive programme.\n\n**Constructive programme during Non-Cooperation Movement and Civil Disobedience Movement:**\n\n* **Communal Unity:** According to Gandhi, communal unity does not merely mean political unity but should be an unbreakable unity of hearts. This was achieved during the Lucknow Pact 1916, whereby both the Indian National Congress and Muslim League joined hands against British rule.\n* **Removal of Untouchability:** Gandhi held that untouchability was a blot and curse upon Indian society. Gandhi endeavoured to abolish this evil. He founded \u2018Harijan Sevak Sangh\u2019 for the abolition of untouchability in 1932 after his Poona Pact.\n* **Khadi Making:** Gandhi presented Khadi as a symbol of nationalism, economic freedom, equality and self-reliance. Khadi takes the central place in the upliftment of the village economy, which eventually lead to the attainment of Gram Swaraj.\n* **New or Basic Education:** Gandhi\u2019s concept of new education implies that nature, society and crafts are huge mediums of education. According to him, true education is that which draws out and stimulates the spiritual, intellectual and physical faculties of the children. This education ought to be for them, a kind of insurance against unemployment.\n* **Upliftment of Women:** In his mission of Swaraj, Gandhi needed the cooperation of women, kisans, labourers and students. It was only due to Gandhi\u2019s efforts that women came out of their houses for the first time in history and participated in the Indian political struggle.\n\nIntegration of Indian society was perhaps more difficult than the achievement of freedom because, in this process, there existed a possibility of conflict between groups and classes of our own people. In this scenario, the Gandhian constructive role played a key role in nation building.",

History stands witness to the fact that the societies that have struggled to hold differences were shattered in such an attempt.\n\n**The supreme social-cultural traditional values of Indian life have been the values of:**\n\n* **A Cosmic Vision: T**he framework of Indian culture places human beings in the centre of the universe, as a divine creation-which celebrates individuality and differences of opinion in society.\n* **Tolerance:** In India, tolerance and liberalism are found for all religions, castes, communities, etc. Indian society accepted and respected various religions and ensured that there is a peaceful co-existence of religions.\n* **Sense of Harmony:** Indian philosophy and culture try to achieve innate harmony and order in society.\n* **Continuity and Stability:** The light of ancient Indian culture life is yet glowing. Many invasions occurred, many rulers changed, many laws were passed but even today, the traditional institutions, religion, epics, literature, philosophy, traditions, etc. are alive.\n* **Adaptability:** It is the process of changing according to time, place, and period. Indian society has shown fluidity and has adjusted itself with changing times.\n* **Caste System and Hierarchy:** Indian Society has evolved systems of social stratification, which in the past helped in accommodating outsiders, but concomitantly it has also been the reason for discrimination and prejudice.\n* **Unity in Diversity:** Despite inherent differences, Indian society celebrates unity in diversity which reflects in modern India\u2019s founding principles and constitutional ideals.\n\n**In recent times, Indian society has seen a surge in multiple divisive issues like:**\n\n* **Casteism:** Caste-based discrimination leads society to divide into artificial groups which sometimes even led to violence.\n* **Communalism:** The aggressive attitude of one community towards the other creates tension and clashes between the two. It poses a great challenge to democracy and the unity of our country.\n* **Nuclear Families:** The new trend of nuclear families with one or a maximum of two children has emerged in India. Due to this children are not able to get the presence of the elderly who plays a major role in instilling values among the younger ones.\n* **Gender Discrimination:** There is a need for India to closely examine the norms that allow violence and a broader pattern of gender discrimination to continue. A society that does not value women as much as men fail to reach its full potential.\n\nDespite all these reasons, India remains a diverse country, a bewildering mosaic of communities of all kinds. Our peculiar societal genius is to fashion a form of coexistence where diversity can flourish and find its place. The principle of \u201c*Sarva Dharma Sambhava*\u201d (equal respect for all religions) is rooted in India\u2019s tradition and culture.",

While today the US is facing the same threat from China, it is not same as the erstwhile USSR:\n\n* In the last few decades China has become the manufacturing hub of the world. Its economy has grown at a rapid pace and forms a special knot in the global supply chain. This is opposed to the USSR, which had a crippled economy and could not compete with the US over the period.\n* The Soviet Union and the United States were hardly interdependent either economically or politically. Although there are divergences and disputes, China and the United States are the two largest economies in the world and share a wide range of interests, especially in the economic sphere. To illustrate, the US and China have a trade of over 500 billion with each other.\n* Today\u2019s global economy is more integrated as compared to the cold war era. Even after two countries are not on good terms with each other, they are still dependent on each other.\n* In the face of internal and external problems, the Soviet Union often repelled, but China has constantly reformed. China outpaced the USSR in governance models and is now challenging the US as a global power.\n\nGiven the high degree of interdependence and the prevalence of globalisation, the so called cold war situation between the US and China may not result in a full-fledged war. Nevertheless, both the countries, in particular, and the global community, in general, must strive to keep the conflicts at minimum and avoid any situation that may precipitate into violent clashes.",

In the center of the wheel are three swirls that represent the three jewels of Buddhism, which are the **Buddha (or the teacher), the Dharma (teachings of Buddha)**, and the sangha (the community).\n  + The **Dharmachakra** takes the **form of a wheel** to represent the **completeness of the Dharma.**\n* **The sculptures, carved panels,** and **open pavilion style temples of Gurjara-Pratihara** are well-known.\n* The most significant advancement in their **temple-building style** occurred at **Khajuraho**, which is now a **UNESCO World Heritage Site.**\n  + The design, structure, and placement of the building's components are symbolic and represent the **core Hindu values.**\n* The most important places in **Rajasthan** where sculptural activity continued to be in progress were **Vasantgarh, Devangarh, Palta, Osian, Dilwara, Chittor, Mandor etc.**\n* **The Gurjara Pratiharas** had a vast kingdom that embraced the territory of **Gujarat, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh.** Their rule in the 8th, 9th and 10th centuries saw a great cultural renaissance.\n  + **Mahishasuramardini in relief, Girigovardhana panel, Arjuna's penance or the Descent of the Ganga, Trivikrama Vishnu, Gajalakshmi and Anatasayanam** are the few prominent sculptures which represent the faith and belief of the society.\n* The **sculptural tradition** in **Gandhara** had the confluence of **Bactria, Parthia** and the **local Gandhara tradition** which reveals the structure and tradition of the society.\n* The **local sculptural tradition at Mathura** became so strong that the tradition spread to other parts of **northern India.**\n  + The best example in this regard is the **stupa sculptures** found at **Sanghol** in the **Punjab.**\n* Images of **Vaishnava** (mainly **Vishnu** and his various forms) and **Shaiva** (mainly the **lingas** and **mukhalingas**) faiths are also found at Mathura. It represents the religious belief of society.\n* The **Chola sculptures** started bronze casting sometime about the middle of the **tenth century A.D.** of the numerous bronze images, the **Nataraja image** in its various forms holds the first place.\n\nTypical life scenarios are shown in sculpture. Nearly all of the sculptures and paintings are motivated by the activities taking place in the immediate vicinity. All works of art, including sculptures, eventually aim to convey a message. Sculptures are created by artists to convey ideas, religious views, historical figures, and even heroic mythical tales.",

      "explanation": "Indians were recruited for the British East India Company's army because they were familiar with the conditions in India. Indians were prepared to take lower wages. As a result, the East India Company's overall expenditures were cheaper than those of contracted British army men. Because of the immense distance that separated Britain from India, the British people were not willing to move India. The English had enforced every available means of war and administrative procedures in order to consolidate their own authority over India.\n\n**Superior military and armaments strategy:**\n\n* The British had cannon and assault rifles that were more advanced in terms of their range and shooting speed than Indian weapons.\n* Many Indian rulers brought European weapons, but they were unable to develop war strategy like British authorities.\n\n**Armed regulation, dedication, and consistent remuneration:**\n\n* The British were very careful about a regular income and a rigid code of conduct that guaranteed the loyalty of the commanders and soldiers.\n* The rulers of India lacked the resources necessary to make regular salary payments.\n* Some of the kings were dependent on their own personal guards of unruly and disloyal mercenaries.\n\n**Effective leadership:**\n\n* Robert Clive, Warren Hastings, Elphinstone, Munro, and others demonstrated exceptional leadership traits.\n* The British also profited from second-line commanders like Sir Eyre Coote, Lord Lake, Arthur Wellesley, and others who stand up for their nation's interests and honor.\n* While the Indian side had excellent commanders like Haider Ali, Tipu Sultan, Madhu Rao, Sindhia, and Jaswant Rao Holkar, they needed a second line of leadership.\n\n**A solid financial foundation:**\n\n* A great deal of wealth was contributed to England by British trade, which led to government assistance in the form of money, materials, and other resources.\n\n**Absence of national pride and unification:**\n\n* Indian rulers lacked a cohesive political nationalism, which the British skillfully exploited to incite civil war among them.\n\nThe East India Company had a private army. The corporation utilized its armed power to impose terrible taxes, carry out officially approved plundering, subjugate Indian governments and principalities with which it had previously entered into commercial deals, and defend its economic exploitation of both skilled and unskilled Indian workers.",

      "explanation": "The term \"famine\" is derived from the Latin word \"Fames,\" which means \"hunger.\" Famine is defined as \"a state of intense hunger experienced by a region's population as a result of a lack of regular food supply.\"\n\n* The **1769-70** famine in **Bengal** followed two years of erratic rainfall but was worsened by a **smallpox epidemic.** The **1783-84** famine again followed a **crop failure** over a wide area.\n\n**Reasons**\n\n* **Drought:**\n  + The excessive rainfall in 1770 did not relieve the people from the sufferings of drought of the year before; on the contrary, it caused overflowing of rivers and damaged standing crops.\n  + The proximate cause of famines, without exception, was a sharp rise in food prices, which in turn reduced real wages and caused starvation, malnutrition and epidemic, mainly among agricultural laborer groups.\n* **Rural Indebtedness:**\n  + Debt has always been a major component of India's rural economy. Due to exorbitant rents and illegitimate taxation imposed by the British Government, peasants were heavily indebted, this indebtedness was exacerbated by the onset of severe drought-like circumstances which culminated in the onset of famines.\n* **British Policy:**\n  + The main cause of the devastating famines during the colonial rule was the British policy of exploitation, repression and oppression inflicted upon the Indian people.\n  + Mass export of agricultural produce to the England by the Britishers led to shortage of the food supply in India which ultimately culminated into the severe famine.\n  + Cornwallis introduced the permanent settlement in 1793. The peasants were dispossessed of their ownership of land by this strategy, which for the first time in India's agricultural history made the zamindars and talukdars the true landowners.\n\nFamines that occurred during the colonial era had a tremendous influence on the economy and even the culture. Famines unquestionably had a negative impact on population growth and slowed down economic development.",

But presently the company was passing through the difficult times as the sales were continuously showing downward trend in the last two quarters. His division, which hitherto had been a major revenue contributor to the company's financial health, was now desperately trying to procure some big government order for them. But their best efforts did not yield any positive success or breakthrough. His was a professional company and his local bosses were under pressure from their London-based HO to show some positive results. In the last performance review meeting taken by the Executive Director (India Head), he was reprimanded for his poor performance. He assured them that his division is working on a special contract from the Ministry of Defence for a secret installation near Gwalior and tender is being submitted shortly.**  \n**He was under extreme pressure and he was deeply perturbed. What aggravated the situation further was a warning from the top that if the deal is not clinched in favour of the company, his division might have to be closed and he may have to quit his lucrative job. There was another dimension which was causing him deep mental torture a and agony. This pertained to his personal precarious financial health. He was a single earner in the family with two school-college going children and his old ailing mother. The heavy expenditure on education and medical was causing a big strain to his monthly pay packet. Regular EMI for housing loan taken from bank was unavoidable and any default would render him liable for severe legal action. In the above backdrop, he was hoping for some miracle to happen. There was sudden turn of events. His secretary informed that a gentleman-SubhashVerma wanted to see him as he was interested in the position of Manager which was to be filled in by him in the company. He further brought to his notice that his CV has been received through the office of the Minister of Defence. During interview of the candidate-Subhash Verma, he found him technically sound, resourceful and experienced marketeer. He seemed to be well-conversant with tendering procedures and having knack of follow-up and liaising in this regard. Prabhat felt that he was better choice than the rest of the candidates who were recently interviewed by him in the last few days. Subhash Verma also indicated that he was in possession of the copies of the bid documents that the Unique Electronics Ltd. would be submitting the next day to the Defence Ministry for their tender. He offered to hand over those documents subject to his employment in the company on suitable terms and conditions. He made it clear that in the process, the Sterling Electric Ltd. could outbid their rival company and get the bid and hefty Defence Ministry order. He indicated that it will be win-win situation for both-him and the company. Prabhat was absolutely stunned. It was a mixed feeling of shock and thrill. He was uncomfortable and perspiring. If accepted, all his problems would vanish instantly and he may be rewarded for securing the much awaited tender and thereby boosting company's sales and financial health. He was in a fix as to the future course of action. He was wonder-struck at the guts of Subhash Verma in having surreptitiously removing his own company papers and offering to the rival company for a job. Being an experienced person,he was examining the pros and cons of the proposal/situation and he asked him to come the next day.**  \n**(a) Discuss the ethical issues involved in the case.**  \n**(b) Critically examine the options available to Prabhat in the above situation.**  \n**(c) Which of the above would be the most appropriate for Prabhat and why?**",

Example: Carvings of the wheel chariot in Airavatesvara Temple.\n\n**Cholas Sculpture:**\n\n* **Chola bronze sculptures,** known for their exceptional craftsmanship, were created **using the lost wax technique. Eg. Nataraja Sculpture** in the Tandav posture.\n* The later chola sculpture shows Bhudevi (earth goddess) as the younger consort of Vishnu.\n* **Temple sculptures of Chola had delicate ornamentation**, pleasing faces and certain freshness. **Eg. Brihadisvara temple, Tanjavur.**\n* Independent figurines of **Parvati portray her in the elegant tribhanga posture.**\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe Chola Dynasty\u2019s patronage, grand temples, architectural innovations, and support for sculptural art led to UNESCO recognition of their temples as world heritage sites.",

      "explanation": "### Approach\n\n* Examines India's cultural diversity and its correlation with socio-economic marginalities.\n* Highlights challenges faced by marginalized groups and opportunities for upward mobility..\n\n### Introduction\n\nIndia's cultural diversity, encompassing various languages, religions, and traditions, intersects with socio-economic factors, resulting in significant marginalization for certain communities facing persistent disadvantages in income, education, and social status.\n\n### Body:\n\n**Correlation Between Cultural Diversity and Socio-Economic Marginality**\n\n* **Historical Stratification:**\n  + The caste system has left Dalits and Adivasis systematically marginalized, facing exclusion from education, jobs, and social mobility. The 2011 Census revealed that Scheduled Castes (SCs) and Scheduled Tribes (STs) had significantly higher poverty rates compared to others. Similarly, the Sachar Committee (2006) highlighted that Muslims suffer from educational and economic deprivation, with lower literacy rates and poorer access to government jobs.\n* **Regional and Ethnic Disparities:**\n  + Tribal communities in central India and ethnic groups in the northeast face underdevelopment and displacement due to mining, infrastructure, and industrial projects. For instance, large-scale displacement caused by the Narmada dam disproportionately impacted Adivasi populations.\n* **Linguistic Marginalization:**\n  + Non-Hindi speaking states, particularly in the south, often express concerns over the central government's focus on Hindi, which they argue sidelines regional languages and leads to resource allocation disparities.\n* **Gender and Intersectionality:**\n  + Women from marginalized communities, like Dalit women, face compounded disadvantages in education, healthcare, and employment, experiencing both caste and gender-based discrimination.\n\n**Counter Arguments**\n\n* **Economic Structures:**\n  + Economic forces like globalization, neoliberal policies, and agrarian distress also exacerbate poverty, affecting both marginalized and non-marginalized communities.\n* **Policy and Governance Failures:**\n  + Poor implementation of schemes like MNREGA and PDS leakages further marginalize disadvantaged groups, revealing governance as a major factor beyond cultural identity.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWhile there is a significant correlation between cultural diversity and socio-economic marginalization, broader economic factors and governance issues also contribute. Addressing both cultural and structural inequalities is essential for achieving socio-economic justice in India.",
