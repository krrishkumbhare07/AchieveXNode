      "explanation": "The framers of the Constitution took note of the fact that tribal communities in the country were suffering from extreme social, educational and economic backwardness arising out of colonial practice of isolation and certain others. On account of these primitive agricultural practices, lack of infrastructure facilities and geographical isolation. These communities needed special consideration for safeguarding their interests and for their accelerated socio-economic development. So these communities were notified as Scheduled Tribes as per provisions of THE CONSTITUTION (SCHEDULED TRIBES) ORDER, 1950 passed by President compliant with Articles 342 of the Constitution.\n\nFor the Socio-economic and overall development of the Tribal people, special provisions and safeguards have been provided in the Constitution of India under following provisions.\n\n* **Art. 15(4):** Special provisions for advancement of other backward classes (which includes STs);\n* **Art. 46:** The State shall promote the educational and economic interests of the Scheduled Tribes, and shall protect them from social injustice and all forms of exploitation.\n* **Art.244:** Clause(1) Provisions of **Fifth Schedule** shall apply to the administration & control of the Scheduled Areas and Scheduled Tribes in any State other than the states of Assam, Meghalaya, Mizoram and Tripura which are covered under **Sixth Schedule,** under Clause (2) of this Article.\n* **Art. 275:** Grants in-Aid to specified States (STs & SAs) covered under **Fifth** and **Sixth Schedules** of the Constitution.\n* **Art.164 (1):** Provides for Tribal Affairs Ministers in Bihar, MP and Orissa.\n* **Art. 330:** Reservation of seats for STs in Lok Sabha.\n* **Art. 337:** Reservation of seats for STs in State Legislatures.\n* **Art. 334:** 10 years period for reservation (Amended several times to extend the period.).\n* **Art. 243:** Reservation of seats in Panchayats.\n* **Art. 371:** Special provisions in respect of NE States and Sikkim.\n\nApart from these provisions, 73rd Amendment Act, Panchayats (Extension to Scheduled Areas) Act, 1996 (PESA) have also been introduced in constitution which have various provisions for upliftment of tribal people.",

In Mumbai, for example, over 50% of the population live in informal settlements. As a result, they have little or no access to basic services: water, sanitation, power and waste management.\n\nGovernment of India launched Smart Cities Mission to identify and roll out smart cities in order to drive economic growth, strengthen governance as well as enhance the quality of life for people.\n\n* A 'smart city' is an urban region that is highly advanced in terms of overall infrastructure, sustainable real estate, communications and market viability. It is a city where information technology is the principal infrastructure and the basis for providing essential services to residents. There are many technological platforms involved, including but not limited to automated sensor networks and data centres.\n* Provision for affordable basic services such as adequate water supply, assured electricity supply, sanitation including solid waste management, affordable housing, especially for the poor, good governance, especially e-Governance and citizen participation etc would be the features of Smart Cities.\n* Apart from this, the government is partnering with countries such as France, Germany, Spain and Singapore to leverage their expertise for making Indian cities smart.\n* In a smart city, economic development and activity is sustainable and rationally incremental by virtue of being based on success-oriented market drivers such as supply and demand. They benefit everybody, including citizens, businesses, the government and the environment.\n\nThese provisions under smart city, if implemented earnestly will go a long way in enabling the urban dweller to have a wholesome experience of city life.",

      "explanation": "Regionalism can be defined as a phenomenon in which people\u2019s political loyalties become focused upon a region. In other words, it implies people\u2019s love of a particular region in preference to the country. Thus the phenomenon of regionalism is centered on the concept of region. Some of the most important the causes of regionalism in India are as follows: **(i) Geographical Factor (ii) Historical and Cultural Factors (iii) Caste and Region (iv)Economic Factors (v) Political-Administrative Factors**.\n\nIn the present times, uneven developments in different parts of the country may be construed as the prime reason for regionalism. There are certain regions in the country where industries and factories have been concentrated, educational and health facilities are sufficiently provided, communication network has been developed, rapid agricultural development has been made possible. But there are also certain areas where the worth of independence is yet to be realized in terms of socio-economic development.\n\nThe British administration may be held responsible for causing such wide regional variations due to their need that suited case of administration, trade and commerce. But in the post-Independence era, efforts should have been made for regional balance in matters of industrial, agricultural and above all, economic development. This disparity has caused the feeling of relative deprivation among the inhabitants of economically neglected regions. It has manifested itself in the demand for separate states such as Bodoland or Jharkhand land, Uttarakhand, etc.\n\nSuccessful demand of separate Telangana state is the manifestation of growing regionalism in India.\n\nIn a country as diverse as India, regionalism is inevitable. However, Through regionally balanced policy making, it can be accommodated as an enabler in the larger goals of national integration.",

    "solution": {
      "explanation": "Delhi has a peculiar federal architecture. Before the 69th Constitutional Amendment Act of 1991, Delhi was a Union Territory. The amendment re-designated it as National Capital Territory of Delhi and designated the administrator of Delhi as the Lieutenant Governor (LG).\n\nFurther, it created a Legislative Assembly and a Council of Ministers for Delhi. The assembly can make laws on all matters of the State List except public order, land and police. The Council of Ministers (CoM) headed by the Chief Minister aid and advice the LG in exercise of his functions except in so far as he is required to act in his discretion.\n\nThe recent cases of conflicts between the LG and the government have largely happened due to assertion of this discretion by the LG with regards to matters such as appointments, like that of Parliamentary Secretaries. The ambiguities with respect to the discretion of LG have resulted in a tussle between his office and the government. The government has accused the LG of acting on behalf of the centre to prevent proper functioning of the government. It claims that the LG should act on the aid and advice of CoM on matters except those stated in the amendment. Since Delhi is the seat of both the national capital territory as well as that of the central government, the centre is bound to have a say in the matters of the city. At the same time, the LG should not interfere in the day to day running of the government. The LG has a dual role to play as an administrative and constitutional head. A balance of jurisdictions needs to be determined so that the citizens don\u2019t suffer as a result of the policy paralysis happening due to this turf war. The ultimate loser is governance and people of Delhi.\n\nThis impasse is not new altogether. Since 1967, when the parties ruling at centre and state started varying, there has been trust deficit between the state/UT govts and the governors or administrators acting on behalf of centre. In Delhi also, successive governments have asked for more power and full statehood. It has just been magnified in current times due to presence of strong leadership at both central and state level. There is a need for harmonious functioning based on the spirit of co-operative federalism between the two.",

    "solution": {
      "explanation": "CAG of India has witnessed a transformation in the last few years, with the constitutionally mandated institution bringing to the fore new issues of accountability in governance. In a decisive shift in its mode of functioning, the country\u2019s supreme audit institution has, in its performance audits, raised questions about the government\u2019s adoption and manner of implementation of key economic policies, instead of being merely an auditor of public expenditure.\n\nThe CAG\u2019s proactive approach has not gone down well with successive governments. However, the CAG has argued that its mandate is to ensure that policy once formulated must also be most optimally implemented.\n\nPolicy formulation is indeed the sole prerogative of the government and the CAG should not be part of policy formulation, process or question the policy. However, in checking efficacy or the efficiency of government schemes and project, it needs to conduct performance audit involving the implementation of the policy. This is imperative to decide whether the policy that has been approved by Parliament or the government meets its objective or not.\n\nThe institution of CAG is no longer that of only auditors as it was probably 50 years back because models of the governance have changed, changing their role from static to dynamic. Hence, in the changing environment of governance, audit of government\u2019s policy implementation becomes a part of the duties of the CAG. This was concurred in the 2013 Supreme Court judgment which held that the CAG's functions to carry out examination into economy, efficiency and effectiveness with which the Government has used its resources, was in-built in the Comptroller and Auditor General's (Duties, Powers and Conditions of Service) Act, 1971, thereby empowering the CAG to conduct performance audit.",

Eg: External Affairs, military, currency etc.\n  + **Provincial List \u2014** Subjects over which provinces had legislative power.

Further, the Federal Legislature was not a sovereign legislature since the Governor General had a veto over the bills passed by it. Hence, it was federal in letter but not in spirit.",

Today, non-state actors are actively engaged in community mobilisation, economic development and societal transformation. They play different roles like capacity building, asset creation, representation, lobbying, advocacy, service delivery etc. Essentially, they are instruments of people's action and the means of protecting and promoting vital rights of citizens. They aid the process of good governance in several ways such as:\n\n* Policy Formulation and Advocacy: Influencing the decisions of legislators, other elected representatives, and public administrators.\n* Watchdog role: Play a crucial role in evaluating the policies and actions of the Government\n* Welfare Service Delivery: Can provide the necessary institutional basis for service delivery\n* Reform and Social Change: Serve as an instrument for reform and social change.\n\nThey have played an instrumental role in the enactment of crucial legislations like the Right to Information Act, the National Food Security Act, Right to Education, MNREGA etc.\n\nAt the same time, their contribution to the governance domain is limited by lack of funds, inadequate trained personnel, lack of culture of volunteering etc. Multiplicity of laws and regulations add to their problems. This prevents the non-state actors from reaching their full potential in enforcing good governance. Considering that India has over 2 million registered NGOs, the scope and extent of their contribution has been below par.",

It adheres to the Constitutional mandate and guiding principles of United Nations and reflects a paradigm shift from a need based to a rights-based approach.\n\n**The main provisions of National Child Policy are**\n\n* The Policy recognizes every person below the age of eighteen years as a child and covers all children within the territory and jurisdiction of the country.\n* It ensure equitable access to comprehensive and essential preventive, promotive, curative and rehabilitative health care of the highest standard, for all children before, during and after birth, and throughout the period of their growth and development.\n* It secures the right of every child to learning, knowledge, education, and development opportunity, with due regard for special needs, through access, provision and promotion of required environment, information, infrastructure, services and supports, for the development of the child\u2019s fullest potential.\n* The policy aims to create a caring, protective and safe environment for all children, to reduce their vulnerability in all situations and to keep them safe at all places, especially public spaces.\n* It enable children to be actively involved in their own development and in all matters concerning and affecting them.\n* It is the first policy document in India that specifically highlights \u2018disability\u2019 as a ground for discrimination that must be countered.\n\n**Status of Implementation**\n\n* The infant mortality rate remains as high as 40. As per the Global Hunger Index, India's hunger levels are ranked as \"serious\" with around 40% of children stunted. The nation ranks 20th among the countries with serious hunger situation. Malnutrition has been one of the huge crisis in India for many years. Though the levels of stunting have declined as per National Family Health Survey, the numbers are still appalling.\n* The RTE has ensured near 100% gross enrollment ratio and most of the children have access to education but the standard of education needs improvement.\n* Child labour and trafficking is still a stigma on Indian society and the rising incidents of crime by juveniles indicate the failure to guide them in the right direction.\n\nNPC 2013 has promised a lot for children\u2019s survival, protection, education and health. However, after recognizing various gaps, the government has now come up with legislations like the Child Labour (amendment) Act, Juvenile Justice Bill etc. The recent Draft National Action Plan for Children 2016 aims to provide a roadmap that links the policy objectives to actionable strategies that will help realize the goals of Child welfare in India.",

Crop insurance provides protection to farmers against losses caused by crop failure and thereby ensures stability in farm income.\n* It also reduces, to some extent, government expenditure incurred on relief measures extended to meet the havoc caused by natural calamities such as droughts and floods, locusts, plant diseases.\n* It also strengthens the position of co-operatives and other institutions that finance, agriculture to the extent it enables the farmer members to repay their loans in years of crop failure.\n* By protecting the economic interest of the farmers against possible risk or loss, it accelerates adoption of new agricultural practices.\n* It may act as anti-inflationary measure, by locking up part of the resources in rural areas.\n\nThe government launched a new crop insurance scheme, PM\u2019s Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) with a view to de-risk agriculture from the vagaries of nature. Salient features of PMFBY are following.\n\n* PMFBY targets to cover 50% India\u2019s cropped area in the next three years. There will be a uniform premium of only 2% to be paid by farmers for all Kharif crops and 1.5% for all Rabi crops.\n* In case of annual commercial and horticultural crops, the premium to be paid by farmers will be only 5%.\n* There is no upper limit on Government subsidy. Even if balance premium is 90%, it will be borne by the Government.\n* The new scheme will also seek to address a long-standing demand of farmers and provide farm-level assessment for localized calamities, including hailstorms, unseasonal rains, landslides and inundation.",

      "explanation": "In the recent years nanotechnology has revolu-tionized scientific research across the globe in a big way. Today, from agriculture to aerospace research, nanotechnology's impact is being felt. Research in nanotechnology spans across an array of fields such as health, environment, agriculture, food and beverages, product development, space technology, power generation, genetics, biotechnology, forensic science, electronics and communications.\n\nAt a commercial level the impact of nanotechnology is on three major industries, namely consumer products, electronics and healthcare. Some applications that make nanotechnology one of the key technologies in 21st century are discussed below:\n\n* Nanosilver provides an effective, broad-spectrum antimicrobial coating to the surface of various consumer products. Therefore silver nanotechnology is being used in a wide range of consumer products such as wound dressings, textiles, food storage containers, paints and personal care appliances.\n* Nanotechnology has significantly scaled down the size of transistors and chips used in the production of computers and other electronic goods.\n* Nanotechnology has made great strides in the field of medicine. Several nano- sized gadgets and materials are being developed to diagnose and treat diseases like cancer more effectively. Nano-pharmacology helps to produce smart drugs that have negligible side effects.\n* Nanoscale thin films on eyeglasses, computer and camera displays, windows, and other surfaces can make them water-repellent, antireflective, self-cleaning, resistant to ultraviolet or infrared light, antifog, antimicrobial, scratch-resistant, or electrically conductive.\n* Scientists are coating fabrics with a thin layer of zinc oxide nanoparticles that give better protection from UV radiation.\n* Using nanoparticles in the manufacture of solar cells is beneficial as they can reduce manufacturing costs by using a low temperature process.",

Whereas the Constitution accords to the President the power to appoint judges with compulsorily consulting with certain persons.\n* Critics say that the Supreme Court, in the second judges\u2019 case, 1993, wrongly interpreted the word \u2018consultation\u2019 used in Articles 124 and 217, to mean concurrence. The court then held that the executive was bound by the advice of the CJI in making appointments to the higher judiciary.\n\nEven the Supreme Court has admitted in the same NJAC judgement that all is not well within the opaque\u00a0 collegium system of \u201c judges appointing judges\u201d and called for further discussion on reform process of collegium system.\n\nThe Constitution envisages and puts a system in place to ensure the balance of power involving the executive, the legislature and the judiciary but not at the cost of opaqueness in appointment process.

The Election Commission has also supported the idea of holding simultaneous elections. \u201cSimultaneous Elections\u201d broadly means structuring the Indian election cycle in a manner that elections to Lok Sabha and State Assemblies are synchronized together.\n\n**Benefits of simultaneous election**\n\n* The 79th Report of the Department related Parliamentary Committee has justified the simultaneous conduct of polls on several grounds, including a huge cut in expenditure incurred for conduct of separate elections every year.\n* Frequent elections lead to imposition of Model Code of Conduct (MCC) over prolonged periods of time and puts on hold the entire development programme and activities of the Union and State Governments in the poll bound State. Simultaneous election will help in limiting amount of time in electioneering.\n* Simultaneous elections would also reduce pressure on manpower and resource deployment necessary for conduct of elections.\n\n**Concerns regarding reducing the government\u2019s accountability to the people**\n\n* Assembly elections are fought on local issues and parties and leaders are judged in the context of their work done in the state. Clubbing them with the general election could lead to a situation where the national narrative submerges the regional story and dilutes the accountability of state leadership.\n\nTherefore, while the idea of simultaneous elections does hold merit, due consideration should be given to both its benedicts and demerits before a decision is taken.\n\nSimultaneous elections are desirable provided they are juxtaposed with certain reforms that would require a prior political consensus to bring a constitutional amendment to curtail or raise term of some states to enable EC to synchronize poll schedule, raise necessary resources of EC such as EVMs, personnel, etc.",

It has come as a breather for estimated 70-100 million disabled citizens of India. Main provisions of the act that ensure inclusion and empowerment are enumerated below\u2013\n\n* The act aims towards more inclusive coverage of the disabled population by increasing the types of disability from existing 7 to 21. Speech and Language Disability and Specific Learning Disability have been added for the first time. Acid Attack Victims have been included.\n* Every child with benchmark disability (at least 40% of the specified disability) between the age group of 6 and 18 years has been given the right to free education. It also recognises the right of a disabled child to study in a main stream school.\n* Additional benefits such as reservation in higher education (not less than 5%), government jobs (not less than 4 %), reservation in allocation of land, poverty alleviation schemes (5% allotment) etc. have been provided for persons with benchmark disabilities\u00a0 and those with high support needs.\n* Stress has also been given to ensure accessibility in public buildings in a prescribed time-frame.\n\nThis act stresses the principles of non-discrimination, full and effective participation and inclusion in society, equality of opportunity, accessibility and respect for the evolving capacities of children with disabilities. Emphasis has been given to right based approach with focus on right to equality and opportunity, right to inherit and own property, right to home and family and reproductive rights among others.\n\nThe act has also been criticised as it misses on special provision to assist persons with mental illness. Many states also could not frame rules under the act within the stipulated time limit. In absence of rules, several key provisions of the act could not be enforced.\n\nWhile the 2016 Act provides many reassurances, brings domestic law in consonance with international standards, and is a huge step forward, its implementation should be monitored carefully to ensure that the needs of persons suffering from disability issues are being comprehensively met.",

This means that tax paid on inputs is deducted from the tax payable on the output produced **(input tax credit)**. This is expected to mitigate the ill effects of cascading.

Therefore different kinds of\u00a0 freedom guaranteed under article 19 will also get amplified and all the legislative acts and executive actions will have to meet the rigours of right to privacy.\n* Similarly, right to equality under article 14 can only be exercised through liberty and freedom of choice.\n* Sexual orientation is a part of the right to privacy and thus the judgement may cast doubts over the legality of Section 377 of the IPC. It may open up a new era of liberty for homosexual individuals and acceptance of same sex marriage in India.\n* Three elements are considered as the core to the right to privacy: Personal autonomy, the freedom to make choices and the right to determine what happens with information about oneself. It will question the Aadhaar scheme, being enforced by the government to avail different kinds of public services. Although the constitutional validity of the Aadhar scheme is yet to be decided by the Constitutional Bench of the Supreme Court.\n\nHowever it should not be forgotten that no fundamental rights are absolute in India and therefore right to privacy will also be guided by the same. Different limitations has been imposed by the constitution itself on the exercise of the fundamental rights. Thus right to privacy will be tested on case-to-case basis. However, the\u00a0 judgement of the Supreme Court will open a new path for securing the privacy, liberty, equality and dignified life for the common man. It will also be helpful in creating a robust legal framework for privacy in India.",

      "explanation": "Electoral reform basically aims at introducing an electoral system of conducting free and fair elections. Keeping in view the necessity to strengthen democracy the Election Commission suggested significant reforms:\n\n* **Constitutional protection for all members of the election commission of India:** ECI suggested that other election commissioners should also be protected in the same manner as Chief Election Commissioner is protected under clause (5) of Article 324.\n* **Budget of the commission to be 'charged':** Presently, the administrative expenditure of the Commission is a voted expenditure. The Commission sent a proposal that the expenditure of the Commission should be charged/ non-votable expenditure on the Consolidated Fund of India similar to other constitutional bodies.\n* **Independent Secretariat:** The Commission proposes that it should have an independent Secretariat along the lines of the Lok Sabha, Rajya Sabha and Registries of the Supreme Court and High Courts.\n* **Proxy voting:** Section 60 of The Representation of the People Act, 1951 should be amended to provide overseas electors the alternative option of proxy voting or postal ballot voting.\n* The Commission proposes that making of any false statement or declaration before the Election Commission should be an electoral offence.\n* The Commission has proposed amendments and suggested dividing the seats in the Council of States and State Legislative Councils into three categories and specifying the term for each category in such a way that biennial retirement of 1/3rd of the members would be ensured.\n* **Use of totalizer for counting of votes:** EVM totalizer can count votes of multiple Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) simultaneously. This way the results of votes in a group of EVMs can be taken without ascertaining the result in individual EVM corresponding to polling booth.\n* Persons charged with cognizable offences shall be de-barred from contesting in the elections, at the stage when the charges are framed by the competent court provided the offence is punishable by imprisonment of at least 5 years, and the case is filed at least 6 months prior to the election in question.",

      "explanation": "National Commission for Women is a statutory organization formed in 1992. It is mandated to review the constitutional and legal safeguards for women; recommend remedial legislature measures; facilitate redressal of grievances and advise the Government on all policy matters affecting women.\n\nSince its inception, the Commission has occupied a considerable space in protecting the rights of weaker section of the population on gender lines. In the past, it has proposed the amendments to the acts such as IPC, 1860 to curb the sale of minor girls, Hindu Marriage Act 1955 to omit epilepsy as grounds for divorce, Dowry Prohibition Act in order to bring the problems of Dowry deaths in to the lime light and deal with them appropriately etc. It also proposed the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Bill which was passed in 2005.\n\nIn recent times, the Commission has adopted the multi-pronged strategy of assisting women in redressal of their grievances, facilitating speedy delivery of justice to women by organising ParivarikMahila Lok Adalats in different parts of the country as well as launching the awareness campaign regarding women\u2019s rights. Recently, the Commission set up several inquiry committees to combat problems faced by women such as in the case of police atrocities and misbehavior with girl students of Kurukshetra University, rape case of a women in Safdarjung Hospital, gangrape of 15 years old girl at Lucknow etc. Further, its Research Cell looks into the emerging problems of Indian women due to discrimination and gender bias.\n\nHowever, there are also examples when the Commission has not been able to come up to the expectations of women in India. For example - on the other serious issue of use of sexual violence against women by police and army personnel in the highly militarised areas of Jammu and Kashmir, north-east and now Chhattisgarh, there has been a silence on this on the part of the commission. Also, the commission has been limited in its fight for empowering Indian women due to shortcomings in its composition and structure:\n\n* It only recommends amendments and submits reports which are not binding on the government\n* It lacks autonomy in terms of appointment of its own members.\n* It is depended on the government for funding which compromises its independence.\n* Its jurisdiction is not applicable to Jammu and Kashmir where the violence against women has increased in the recent past.\n\nThus there is a need to safeguard the political autonomy of NCW by replacing the current nomination system with a transparent, democratic and non-partisan selection process for members and chairperson of the commission. It should also be given the wider power to enforce its recommendations and provide immediate relief to the victim of women discrimination and violence.",

      "explanation": "**(a) Demerit** Strict adherence to ethical conduct may cause problems in carrying out certain aims both in public and private life causing disaffection arising out of inability to reach goals. Being upright also pits the person against powerful vested interest, endangering his and his family\u2019s life, which may not be worth the cost of ethical principles.\n\n**Merit:** Even though adherence to ethical conduct may produce disaffection from inability to reach certain short term career goals, but mere attainment of materialistic goals cannot be essence of life. Achieving goals by unfair means would prick our conscience and erode strength of character. The security of life and family members can also be assured for a person of upright character by preventing him from being implicated on charges of wrongdoing.\n\nIn the long run ethical conduct always helps in achieving life\u2019s larger goals, such as mental peace, clear conscience, strength of character and brings harmony and balance in life.\n\n**(b) Demerit:** When a large number of people are corrupt, a few good men can\u2019t help salvage the situation as their voices drown in the majority. Moreover, in such a scenario upright men are deemed as obstruction by others in achieving their selfish aims through unfair means. This brings the upright men in direct confrontation with such corrupt forces, sometimes endangering their values, life and career. For example, civil servant Satyendra Dubey was killed while standing against the corrupt forces.\n\n**Merit:** Even though there might be instances of large number of corrupt prevailing over few honest individuals, it\u2019s these few upright men that sustain the faith of people in humanity and society. They act as check against larger wrongdoings, constraining their power and also exposing and uprooting them. They act as role model for larger society to adhere to what is right. For example, Anna Hazare stood up as a crusader against corruption; T.N. Seshan, the chief election commissioner, countermanded elections in Bihar, U.P. citing mass rigging.\n\n**(c) Demerit:** Ethical means may at times not merge with the larger developmental ends. In trying to adhere to correct means, if one misses the goals then means lose their significance, no matter how ethical they were. For example, Robinhood morals may achieve larger goal of saving the poor, even if by questionable means of looting the rich, than sticking to moral means and letting the poor die of hunger.\n\n**Merit:** To preserve the ethical and moral values it is important that both means and ends are right. Trying to achieve a noble goal with unethical means impinges upon the ethical fabric of individual and society at large, prompting a person for further compromises in the future. For example; Gandhiji emphasised upon the means to be ethical through way of Ahimsa as much as he emphasised on the result, the independence.\n\n**(d) Demerit:** Exchange of small gifts is sometimes seen as essential to maintain formal relations, as a symbol of gratitude for the services rendered. Not accepting gifts may be perceived to be rude, morally arrogant and at times may isolate the person from the larger circle of this give and take culture.\n\n**Merit:** Sometimes corruption is not carried out explicitly but is masked in form of these small exchanges, rendering bigger scandals possible. Hence, it is essential to nip this menace in the bud. Not accepting any form of gifts indicates a strong moral and ethical character preserving the trust of people in person in the long run.",

      "explanation": "In a democracy, there is nothing more important than the credibility of the electoral process. Recently, many political parties in India have been seeking for a return to the ballot paper. The issue pertains to the efficacy and credibility of EVMs in conducting free and fair elections.\n\nEVMs have brought a structure to the electoral process that did not exist during the ballot paper days when the number of invalid votes would often be high and incidents of booth capturing were a common phenomenon. However, recently the transparency and efficacy of EVMs have been questioned. The Election Commission of India faces the following challenges in this regard:\n\n* To prove to the electorate and the parties that the EVMs are not manipulated and tempered.\n* The EVMs are selected by computers on the principle of randomization which does not allow a prior knowledge or planned setting for a particular EVM in a particular constituency or at a particular polling booth. But the challenge before the commission is to account for the authenticity of these processes.\n* It is also being opined that the present EVMs are not technologically advanced and secure.\n* Ensuring an independent and robust verification system in the whole exercise of manufacturing and placement of EVMs, and registeration and counting of votes.\n* Though EC has decided to use Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT) machines in all future elections, it is yet to take a decision on tallying all votes cast through EVMs. So far, it has only ordered recounting of VVPAT slips on pilot basis.\n* In recently concluded by-elections (e.g. in Kairana Lok Sabha by-elections) there were reports of last minute glitches with EVM and VVPAT which raises doubt about their functioning.\n* Another challenge is to procure required VVPAT without delay for the Lok Sabha elections 2019.\n* Considering the complexity VVPAT is introducing in to electoral process there is need for competent polling officers.\n* VVPATs are very complicated and slight mishandling can result in failure. E.g. In Meghalaya Assembly by polls more than 33 per cent VVPATs failed as the paper used was not suitable for the humid weather there.",

      "explanation": "The National Commission for Scheduled Castes (NCSC), a constitutional body set up under Article 338, recently directed the Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) to provide reservations for SC/ST and OBC category students. Till now, AMU did not provide reservations since it is considered a religious minority institution under article 30.\n\nThis is because minority educational institutions, which have a 50 per cent reservation for students belonging to a minority community, do not have to provide reservations for SC/ST and OBC category students. The Supreme Court, in July 2018, upheld this. It drew light to Article 15(5), introduced by the 93rd Constitutional Amendment Act. According to Article 15(5), the state is empowered to make special provisions for the advancement of scheduled castes regarding their admission to educational institutions, except in the minority educational institutions.\n\nTherefore, the according to the Constitution of India, minority institutions under Article 30 shall be exempt from constitutional reservations for the Scheduled Castes. As a result, it would be unconstitutional for NCSC to enforce implementation of constitutional reservation in the religious minority institutions.",

These committees fulfil several objectives:\n\n* These help Parliament in managing its business in a better way. It is easier to examine a topic in depth by a committee of 30 than by an assembly of 700.\n* These enable inputs from experts and also directly from people. For example, the Departmental Standing Committees often invite comments from the public and call people to testify.\n* A related advantage in the Indian context is that the anti-defection law does not apply to committees \u2014 therefore, decisions are not usually made on party lines.\n* These committees allow members to focus on some specific areas and build their expertise, which helps them scrutinise issues more thoroughly.\n* These keep an unremitting vigil over Government expenditure and performance. For e.g. Public Accounts Committee.\n\n**Role of the Estimates Committee**\n\nEstimates Committee compromises of 30 members solely from Lok Sabha. Its main agenda is to examine the estimates included in the budget and suggest economies in public expenditure. It suggests alternative policies in order to bring about the efficiency and economy in administration. It brings to the notice of the Parliament, the ineffectiveness of the policy and need for changes in policy.\n\nHowever, the effectiveness of the role of the committee is limited by the followings-\n\n* It cannot question the policy laid down by the Parliament.\n* It examines the budget estimates only alter they have been voted by the Parliament, and not before that.\n* Its recommendations are advisory and not binding on the ministries.",

      "explanation": "Parliament via 69th Constitutional Amendment Act of 1991 inserted Article 239AA which made provisions for Legislative Assembly and Lieutenant Governor for NCT Delhi. Since the insertion of the new provisions the political tussle between Lt. Governor and elected government of Delhi has been observed regarding running of day to day business, stalling Council of Minister\u2019s (CoM) decisions, and control over the bureaucratic machinery. Prima facie the tussle relates to the supremacy of the Union appointed Lt. Governor and the elected government. It becomes more palpable when different parties are in power at centre and at Union Territory of Delhi.\n\nAccording to the Article 131 of the constitution of India, Supreme Court has original jurisdiction in any dispute between the Government of India and one or more States. Accordingly, the Supreme Court in its recent judgment of July 2018 provided for a solution to settle this political tussle.\n\n* In relation to the issue of power to legislate and make policies, the Supreme Court held that by virtue of Clause (4) of Article 239AA, the elected government has the power to legislate on all issues except for subjects relating to land, police and public order, which is under the exclusive domain of Union Parliament.\n* On issues of discord between the Lt. Governor and Council, the Supreme Court held that Lieutenant is not to act in a mechanical manner and stall CoM\u2019s decision. Further in case of any difference, matter can be referred to President but it should be in exceptional cases and not a general rule of business.\n\nThe noble principles of democracy and deliberation have been worded by Supreme Court in this case, which provide ample amount of guiding light to settle the power tussle. But the solution to political tussle between the Lt. Governor and elected government of Delhi lies in discarding the anarchist or absolutist approach, focus on working harmoniously, settling disputes by discussion and keeping the interest of people above narrow political interest.",

In USA, democracy got its full swing with the drafting of the US Constitution in 1789 while the democracy in India is partially a result of British rule followed by the enforcement of the new, modern and living constitution, framed after Independence.\n\n**The basic tenets on which the two political systems based are:**\n\n* **Rule of Law and Republicanism:** Both, the countries have written constitutions ensuring rule of law and guaranteeing fundamental rights to their citizens. Both the countries are republican in nature and provide adult franchise to the citizens.\n* **Separation of Powers:** In USA, there is a clear-cut separation of powers between judiciary, executive and legislature while the same is not observed exactly in India, as there is fusion between executive and legislature.\n* **Federal System:** India is a federal parliamentary democratic republic in which the President of India is the head of state and the Prime Minister is the head of government whereas the United States is a federal presidential republic in which the President is the head of the state and of the government as well. As per Article 1, India is a \u201cUnion of states\u201d which implies that Indian federation is not the result of an agreement among the states unlike USA whose federation is result of agreement among the states. However, Indian federalism has more features of unitary form of government than that of the US.\n* **Independent Judiciary:** Both the political systems provide for an independent judiciary to interpret the constitution and enforce the law. However, in India single system of courts enforces both the central laws as well as the state laws but in USA, the federal laws are enforced by the federal judiciary and the state laws are enforced by the state judiciary.\n* **Party System:** US has bi-party system while India has multi-party system.\n\nThough the US and Indian political systems are similar in many respects, yet they are the product of their unique history and socio-economic milieu, and varying political culture. However, they should cooperate with each other on many fronts to provide a hope to the humanity which is facing numerous challenges.",

To redress it, the constitution or the legislations have provided for National Commissions for SCs and STs, Minorities, Women and Children.\n\nThe prime intention is to protect their constitutional rights, coordination in socio-economic and educational development, and address atrocities related matters. However, there are certain issues with regard to their multiciplity and functions like:\n\n* Overlapping jurisdictions and duplication of efforts in dealing with complaints, and addressing grievances.\n* Data duplications lead to narrow implementation and this negatively impacts the intended outcomes.\n* Low financial independence and politicization of commissions, absence of checks and balances, etc.\n\nOn the other hand, National Human Rights Commission along with its states counterparts, has more pervasive mandate to enquire into complaints, recommend actions, identify vulnerabilities, etc. Besides, National and State Commissions do not trespass their respective jurisdiction.\n\nWe can envision to create an umbrella organisation like Human Rights Commission (unified), merging all the existing commissions. It is feasible given the nature of all commissions aiming to secure the dignified living conditions and protection of human rights.\n\nIt will remove the multiciplity, data duplication, and will help in more sector specific policy formulation keeping in mind the different vulnerability faced by them. The Human Rights Commission (unified) should have the implementing arms or agencies at state, district and local levels to synchronise its efforts and consolidate the available data.\n\nEstablishment of umbrella commission will be more fiscal and policy prudent. Having fiscal independence and power to enforce legal provisions will strengthen its mandate. Technology can be employed to promote more coordination among different sections to promote analysis and policy formulation and implementation.\n\nThe Human Rights Commission (unified)needs to be given more teeth in terms of independent powers, functions and finance, to enforce its mandate and realize the socio- economic development of the vulnerable sections of society.",

      "explanation": "The Union Budget of 2018-19 introduced the following two important changes:\n\n* Long Term Capital Gains Tax (LTCGT): Reintroduction of a 10% tax on long term capital gains arising from transfer of listed equity shares.\n* Dividend Distribution Tax (DDT): Introduction of a 10% tax on distributed income by equity oriented mutual fund.\n\nThe long-term capital gains tax existed until 2005 but was removed to encourage greater participation in the equity markets. Though it did have its intended effect but it also had the side-effect of business surpluses being invested in financial assets due to attractive return on investments. This benefitted corporates primarily and also created a bias against investing in manufacturing. It has also led to significant erosion in the tax base resulting in revenue loss.\n\nKeeping in mind the points mentioned above, the decision to bring back long term capital gains tax on listed equities holds merit. Moreover, LTCG in unlisted shares are currently taxed - LTCGT on listed shares ends the advantage enjoyed by the latter, bringing them on par.\n\nIn addition, the tax on distributed income by equity oriented mutual funds will provide level playing field across growth oriented funds (where the dividend is re-invested back into stocks) and dividend distributing funds (investors receive regular income through dividends). Up until now, dividends from equity-oriented funds were tax-free and were also exempt from paying the DDT.\n\nHowever, these changes should also be followed by abolishing or reducing the securities transaction tax rates (levied on all transactions made on the stock exchanges), which could lead to double taxation if continued.",

      "explanation": "Individual freedom and rights at one hand and larger interest of society or the nation on the other are perennial source of conflict. The given situation also highlights the very same fact. There are times when two competing values create dilemma. Here the competing values are (1) morality and legality and (2) individual liberty (privacy) and national security.\n\n### Morality vs Legality\n\nThese both values are closely related as both seek to regulate human behavior and actions. But actions which may be legally correct may not be morally correct or vice-versa. It is an eternal dilemma which will occur in the future as well. Law is necessary to maintain order and minimum co-ordination in the society. Morality is the differentiation of intentions, decisions, and actions between those that are distinguished as proper and those that are improper. Both seek justice in different ways and help attaining stability in the society. Establishing precedence of one over other would not be a wise option. In this case, Edward Snowden has legally violated the Espionage Act, 1917, but his act must be looked with his intentions to serve the larger public good.\n\n### Individual Liberty vs National Security\n\nIndividual liberty (privacy) seeks to provide individual space to humans. This value respects the intricate relations of a person, personal feelings of people etc., which are essential because we are humans. National security seeks protection of society from all kinds of threats and it is the duty of the state to protect its citizens, boundaries, economy etc. No nation becomes great by dwarfing its own individual. The surveillance programme was a gross violation of its own mandate. Snowden\u2019s act in this case should not be considered as threat to national security.\n\nIn the above mentioned conditions, it should be understood that all these values cannot propagate mutually exclusive to each other. There must be certain limitations or domain under which national security and individual liberty should operate. Legality and morality come to one\u2019s conscience. Conscience can be a compass in difficult demanding conditions. In the mentioned case, Snowden was in a dilemma and surveillance was a gross violation in the name of national security, so he was right in exposing the government.",

      "explanation": "India is set to become the most populous nation in 2027, surpassing China, according to an estimation by the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs. India\u2019s population has ballooned from 555.2 million in 1970 to 1,366.4 million in 2017.\n\nThere are multiple causes of population growth in India such as child marriage and multi marriage system, religious superstitions, illiteracy and unawareness, poverty etc. However, they are in one way or the other linked to the poor condition of women in the nation.\n\nThus empowering women can play a crucial role in controlling the population growth\n\n* Women are at times financially weak to pay for needed family planning and health services. Access to and control over productive resources will result in increased voice, agency and meaningful participation in decision-making at all levels from family planning to the time of conceiving.\n* The failure of family planning is directly related to large-scale illiteracy that also contributes to the early age of marriage, low status of women, high child-mortality rate etc. They are least aware of the various ways to control population, usage of contraceptives and birth control measures.\n* Uneducated families cannot grasp the issues and problems caused by the increasing population rate. Education has a transformative impact on girls. Educated girls tend to work more, earn more, expand their horizons, marry and start having children later with fewer children.\n* Fertility rates are high because of misinformation about side-effects of contraceptives, lack of knowledge about the benefits of small families, and religious or male opposition to contraception.\n* Any woman with multiple children spends most of her life as a mother and wife. She cannot play any meaningful role in her community and society until she is able to limit her family to a proper size. Family planning will not only improve family welfare but also contribute to achieving social prosperity and personal happiness.\n* It is also crucial to sensitize men and boys at a young age, so they become an integral part in bringing about a transformation of women empowerment in Indian society. When men start respecting women and accepting them as equals, a lot of gender-based inequalities will reduce considerably.\n\nThe unbridled growth of population is a problem that our country needs to overcome. The government, NGOs and the people of society have to work together to solve the problem of overpopulation in our country. India, however, needs to put more efforts on empowering its women who can help the country curb the growth of its population. As also mentioned by Nehru, to awaken the people, first women need to be awakened, because once a woman has been awakened then the whole nation and family get awakened with her.",

      "explanation": "Gandhian Phase in Indian freedom struggle is undoubtedly remarkable because of the perspective Gandhiji provided to the masses and the way he guided the freedom fighters with the means of truth and non-violence.\n\nBut there were numerous other simultaneous factors which further strengthened Gandhi\u2019s efforts and contributed to the nationalist movement.\n\n### Voices which strengthened and enriched the nationalist movement:\n\n* **Khilafat Movement (1919-22)** was launched by the Indian Muslims to pressurise the British government to preserve the authority of Ottoman Sultan as Caliph of Islam. Gandhi and Congress leaders viewed it as an opportunity for **cementing Hindu-Muslim unity** and **bringing the Muslims** in the National Movement although this event is said to have brought the issue of religion in the freedom struggle.\n* The ideological differences between the **Swarajists and the No-Changers** within the congress led to serious changes and contribution. No-changers continued their **constructive programme** of spinning, temperance, Hindu-Muslim unity, removal of untouchability etc whereas Swarajists won the election of Central Legislative Assembly in november 1923 **filling the political void** while the national movement was regaining its strength.\n* **Marxism and other socialist ideas** spread rapidly in 1927 under **J.L. Nehru and S.C. Bose\u2019s leadership**. The **left wing** did not confine its concern to freedom struggle only but **raised the question of internal class oppression by the capitalists and landlords**. It strengthened the **voices of the marginalised and poor** of the country and connected them to the movements.\n* **Revolutionaries** like **R.P. Bismil, C.S. Azad and Bhagat Singh** among others took the responsibilities of informing people about a necessary revolution to uproot British Empire. The **Terrorist Movement in Bengal led by Surya Sen** is notable because of the role of revolutionary women who participated.\n* **Students and peasant parties** got involved and propagated Marxist and communist ideas while remaining an integral part of the national movement and the Congress. In **1928, Bardoli Satyagraha** occurred under the leadership of **Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel** bringing forward **farmers\u2019 concerns**.\n* There was rapid growth of **trade unionism** under the leadership of **All India Trade Union Congress** and many strikes took place during 1928 like **Kharagpur, Jamshedpur and Bombay Textile Mill strike** is the most important. The **traders and workers** contributed to the struggle for independence.\n* Women from all over India were not left alone. They came forward and equally contributed to the national movement. **Kasturba Gandhi, VIjay Laxmi Pandit, Aruna Asaf Ali, Bhikaji Cama** are some of the most prominent who assumed leadership at different fronts.\n\nEven the **Business class participated** by giving financial assistance and rejecting imported goods Every class, section, age group, political ideology emerged, came forward and contributed to the national movement. Even though it weakened the movement to some extent by the fragmentation and the internal ideological differences, it mainly made the movement strong by diversifying it and adding alternative perspectives to it. This multidimensional nature of the movement is one of the reasons for its success in 1947 when finally all the unheard voices till then were heard.",

      "explanation": "Indian constitution have meticulously defined powers and functions of the different organs of the state. Legislature, executive and judiciary have to function within their own spheres demarcated under the constitution. Unlike the US constitution, instead of having strict separation of power India follows the principle of \u2018checks and balance\u2019 which is evident from the various constitutional provisions dealing with executive, legislative and judicial organs.\n\n* The executive power of the state is exercised by the President, who acts on the advice tendered by the council of ministers headed by the Prime Minister. However, according to article 75, the council of ministers with the responsibility of forming policies and implementing them are the members of the Parliament and responsible to the Lok Sabha.\n* Under the constitutional provision, Parliament in India includes the Lok Sabha, the Rajya Sabha and the President. Parliament, the legislative body, has the head of executive as its integral part. Accordingly, the parliament uses different motions like censure motion, no confidence motion, etc., to check the functioning of the council and hold them responsible. Further, the Parliament under article 61, can impeach the President for violation of the Constitution.\n* Within the constitutional provision India has an independent judiciary with the Supreme Court at its apex. Provision of judicial review and writ under Article 32 and 226 empowers the Supreme Court and the High Courts respectively to check the constitutional validity of the executive and legislative actions. Independence of the judiciary has been ensured in the constitution but the same has been interlinked with executive and legislative organ of the government. For instance appointment and transfer of judges of High Courts and the Supreme Court is done by the executive. Further, the removal of the judges of the High Courts and Supreme court is done by the Parliament.\n* Idea behind the doctrine of separation of powers is to create separate power centers rather than having all power concentrated in a single institution. Though on the whole, the doctrine of separation of power in the strict sense is not possible in modern political system, its value lies in emphasis of checks and balance, which are necessary to prevent abuse of power and uphold the rule of law. All three of them are strong pillars of India which support and strengthen each other. Thus, keeps a check and ensures smooth functioning of the whole system and the nation.",

    "solution": {
      "explanation": "Division of power is a basic feature of federalism. The Constitution provides for a three-fold distribution of legislative subjects between the Union list, the state ist, and the Concurrent List in the Seventh Schedule. However, contention develops in categorization of legislation into the entries of these three lists. To resolve these contentions, courts have evolved various principles.\n\n### Principle of harmonious construction\n\nWhen there is a conflict between the statue\u2019s provisions between the union and state list then the rule of harmonious construction needs to be adopted. The rule follows a very simple premise that every statute has a purpose and intent and should be read as a whole. The widest interpretation of the provisions of the statute should be allowed. Also, the Court should help in removal of the inconsistency of the statute\u2019s language in order to reconcile the contention. For instance, the conflict between centre and state arose in **Shri Krishna Rangnath Mudholkar vs Gujarat University, 1963** on the validity of Gujrat University Act. The court used this principle to allow the State government to make law on excluded items(reserved for the centre) as an extension to its power to legislate on education, to the extent it does not contradict the union law.\n\n### Principle of Federal Supremacy\n\n* When a statute\u2019s provisions fall in both state and union list, then the centre would have the dominant legislative power. The state and concurrent list are subordinate to the Union list. The Supreme court can apply this principle as a last resort if attempts to find a solution under the Principle of Federal Supremacy fails.\n* In the era of cooperative and competitive federalism, conflicts should be minimized as far as possible. States should bring reform in important areas like Police, Agriculture marketing, etc. and coordinate with other states and centre in order to have a uniform legislative framework in key areas. With the recent steps like one nation, one ration card, more federal cooperation would be necessary.",

      "explanation": "A million women have been elected at the village, block and district levels, following the 73rd Constitutional Amendment which reserved 33 percent of seats in Panchayati Raj Institutions for women. The process of decentralization has provided representation but representation has not always led to their participation in the Indian political process.\n\n### Patriarchal Character of Indian Political Process\n\n* **The practice of \u201cSarpanchpatis\u201d**: The effective political power and decision making are wielded by husbands or other male relatives of elected women representatives. This makes the intended empowerment of women through reservation infructuous.\n* **Rubber stamps:** Most of these women are just rubber stamps with the men in their house- can be the husband, father or the son - running the show. They also work as proxies for rural elites hence restricting their autonomy.\n* **Lack of exposure** of women themselves to politics and the absence of any experience in exercising their political responsibilities hinder their participation. Since most women are illiterate and do not have any training of handling technical issues and financial deals, they have no option but to take assistance from male family members.\n* **Stereotypes and traditional norms:** This relegates women to the domestic sphere and dissuades them to engage in public affairs. Caste and class factors also play a key role that restrict women to take leadership roles.\n* **The burden of household responsibilities,** purdah (veil) system, etc adversely affect their performance.\n\n**However, there have also been many positive impacts of women representation:**\n\n* Women have done considerable development work on the ground, for example, women sarpanch of Dhani Miyan Khan Gram Panchayat in Haryana built a training centre for women and ensured that every village child went to school.\n* Elected women representatives are also more accessible than their male counterparts who are often not around.\n* It has been seen that though women lacked confidence initially but exposure to local politics gave them new confidence to take independent decisions and not become a proxy of male candidates.\n* There has been a marked improvement in social development parameters such as education and health where panchayats are led by women.\n\n### Way forward\n\n* Capacity Building of Elected Women Representatives (EWR) and Functionaries of PRIs: This would prepare women to discharge multiple roles, enabling them to raise local priorities to the planning process.\n* Strengthening women\u2019s groups and building networks: Formation of women\u2019s forums and networks to develop a sense of solidarity amongst the women.\n* Institutionalisation of mechanisms to strengthen the capacity building of EWRs to better understand and perform their functions.\n* Mobilisation of community and strengthening the processes of constituency building to enable women to better articulate their voices and participate in the electoral process.\n\nThe reservation of women at the local level has had various social and developmental impacts like promotion of nutrition, sanitation drive, behavioral changes, etc. Also, women are more aware of their rights now which could be seen in women voters outnumbering men voters in states like Bihar. However, women\u2019s participation in politics in a true sense is still to be realized. Their participation in the political process is a matter of human right and a key in deepening our democracy. It would also help India in realizing the SDG-5 (Sustainable Development Goal) that aims to end gender inequality in all forms.",

From 2014-2018 about 900 private member Bills were introduced in the Parliament but not even 2% of these bills were discussed.\n\nIn a mature parliamentary system, all ideas should be debated and decided upon. While the legislative ideas piloted by the government get discussed, the ideas of individual MPs get accumulated and more than often remain ignored.\n\n### Reasons for the Decline\n\n* A successful passing of a private member\u2019s Bill is often perceived by many as incompetence on the part of the government and intrusion into the respective Ministry\u2019s domain. If such a legislation is seen getting support in Parliament, the government requests the MP to withdraw it and promises to introduce it as a Government Bill instead.\n* Without support from the ruling party or a party that commands majority, it becomes impossible to pass a private member\u2019s Bill especially in the Lok Sabha.\n* There has also been a shift to law-making by ordinance, which completely bypasses the formal route of debate and discussions. For e.g., the promulgation of the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Ordinance, 2018.\n* Even individual parliamentarians are obliged to toe the party line, through regulatory frameworks like the Anti-Defection Act. This discourages any deviation from the party decision and takes out the possibility of diverse perspectives that parliamentarians as individuals can offer.\n* Quality of the elected Individual Parliamentarians also affect the quality of debate and discussions in the house. According to the Association for Democratic Reforms\u2019 report (2014), 30% of sitting MPs and MLAs were facing some form of criminal proceedings, and only 0.5% were convicted of criminal charges in a court of law.\n  + Currently, a large part of the voting population views their representatives as their problem solvers. So they are willing to vote for a candidate who can get things done ignoring his involvement in a crime.\n\n### Way Forward\n\n* The Anti-Defection Act needs to be recast, and used only in the most exceptional circumstances, while allowing MPs greater freedom of self-expression.\n  + The UK, for example, has the concept of a free vote allowing MPs to vote as they wish on particular legislative items. This in effect allows voting in line with the parliamentarians\u2019 conscience, judgement and interests of her electorate.\n* Research staff and resources should be increased for Individual Parliamentarians as the availability of expert in-house advice can further boost their ability to contribute to the national law making process.\n* People\u2019s perception of what they want from their representative should change so that MPs can be viewed as lawmakers with character and integrity. This requires a fresh pool of candidates who can appeal to the voters by their abilities as good lawmakers with innovative ideas.\n* However, apart from paying respect and giving encouragement to the legislations framed by the Individual Parliamentarians, several other issues also need to be addressed to improve the overall quality of discussions in the Indian Parliament and in governance in India. For eg, Members of Parliament have to address their low attendance and increase their engagement in the discussions. Similarly they have to utilise the limited parliamentary time for proceedings judiciously without unnecessary disruption.",

      "explanation": "India continues to remain one of the fastest growing economies in the world. Despite recent slowdown, India\u2019s growth of real GDP has been high with average growth of 7.5% in the last five years. As per Economic Survey 2018-19, the services sector accounts for 54% of India GVA. FDI equity inflows into the services sector account for more than 60% of the total FDI equity inflows into India.\n\n### Components of Indian services sector\n\nThere are twelve identified sectors where the government wants to give focused attention for promoting their development which are:\n\n* Education Services\n* Health & Wealth Services\n* Accounting & Finance Services\n* Financial services\n* Tourism & Hospitality Services\n* Transport & Logistics Services\n* Legal Services\n* Telecommunication Services\n* Media & Entertainment services\n* IT & IT enabled services\n* Consultation & Related engineering services\n* Environmental services\n\n### Cooperation among various services sub-sectors\n\n* Initiative of **Bharatmala project** not only provide connectivity through better **transportation** services but also creates employment in **construction sector** thereby promoting **tourism** in remote areas.\n* **UDAAN scheme** to boost air connectivity not only promotes regional development but also leads to growth in housing and real estate sector, construction, building materials, tourism, etc.\n* **ISRO\u2019s technology** of lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries for electric vehicles (EV) is being used in the **automobile sector**.\n* Increasing digital connectivity through **BharatNet project** benefitted **education** and **health** services in rural areas.\n* **e-Commerce services** reaching the rural areas through increased mobile **internet connectivity**.\n* Initiatives like **Start-up India** giving boost to start-ups in multiple domains like health care, inter-city cab services, online food delivery businesses, etc.\n* Investment in higher **education** produces high quality IT professionals needed for the fast growing **IT services** sector.\n\nHence, different sectors have **functional inter-linkages** and investment in one sector creates multiplier effect benefitting the entire economy.\n\n### Cooperation at leadership level\n\nThe fastest growing Indian economy provides vast opportunity for collaboration among different departments of the government and with businesses as well. This can be seen in India\u2019s development process through the following examples:\n\n* Government initiative to provide focused attention to 12 identified **Champion services sectors** through partnership at different levels.\n* Introduction of **GST** required collaboration among centre, states, and with business groups.\n* Introduction of **Government e-Marketplace** as a technology driven platform to facilitate procurement of goods and services by various ministries and agencies of the government.\n* **NITI Aayog** facilitating implementation of programmes and focus on technology upgradation and capacity building, fostering better inter-ministry coordination and better centre-state coordination.\n\nServices sector not only promotes economic growth but also creates opportunity for development in human capital. Thus, India\u2019s huge demographic dividend can only be productively utilized if there is a culture of \u2018collaboration\u2019 and \u2018team spirit\u2019 at all levels of governance architecture.",

      "explanation": "The welfare schemes are the schemes, designed to provide the necessary means for the development of individuals, groups or a community. Generally, they are targeted towards the vulnerable and marginalised section of the society.\n\nHowever, It is observed that the benefits intended to be delivered to the people through these schemes do not reach the beneficiaries because of weakness in administrative planning delivery mechanism and lack of awareness of the targeted groups. It is also observed that many development projects and programmes have failed in the past because of the inadequacies in design, implementation,involvement and general awareness about the policy in the public.\n\n### Ineffectiveness of the Policies\n\n* Weak professional support to design, implement and monitor schemes at national, state and local levels.\n* Too realistic or too optimistic assumptions, based on technical and non-technical parameters without the knowledge of the local situation, proper database and resource constraints, making the policies suffer at last.\n* Poor policy formulation due to the unawareness about the vulnerable sections and area specific approach to handle distinct groups.\n* No systematic attempt to identify people who need welfare schemes, determine their needs, address them and enable them properly.\n* Inadequate analysis of environmental and rehabilitation implications.\n* Delays in clearances from regulatory authorities for land acquisition and in procurement of resources due to poor planning and coordination.\n* Inability of the project management to take prompt decisions on various levels of policy making even if they are necessary to achieve the objectives.\n* There is no consistent approach in the design of delivery mechanisms and do not provide flexibility needed for different development levels of a policy.\n* Lack of strict time frames, financial mechanisms and inter agency cooperation pose challenges.\n* Most of the schemes are unrelated to each other with little horizontal convergence or vertical integration resulting in conflicts.\n* Policies and programmes are not evaluated on their outcomes instead focus stays on monitoring finances.\n* No method to ensure that policies reach everybody they are meant for.\n\nThe quality of policy framework and effectiveness of implementation of the policies are as important as the availability of resources for the realisation of the intended policy objectives. Availability of funds alone is not sufficient for tackling socio-economic problems like poverty and backwardness. Both implementing bodies as well as the benefitting people have to be aware of each others\u2019 situations and work harmoniously.",

    "solution": {
      "explanation": "The Union Government by amending NIA Act and UAPA Act seeks to provide **more powers to India\u2019s anti-terror agency** and **expand the scope of India\u2019s anti-terror law,** thereby providing a **big push to India\u2019s internal security machinery**.\n\nUnder the **UAPA Act**, the Central Government can designate an organisation as a terrorist organisation if it commits or participates in acts of terrorism; promotes terrorism; or is otherwise involved in terrorism. Currently, only an organisation can be declared a terrorist. The amendment allows government to **designate individuals** suspected to have terror links as **'terrorists'**.\n\nLikewise, the amendment to **NIA Act** widens the powers of the National Investigation Agency (NIA) to investigate crimes related to human trafficking, counterfeit currency, dealing in prohibited arms, and cyber-terrorism. These were earlier under State police. NIA can also investigate a crime irrespective of its place of occurrence.\n\nThese amendments are in pursuance of the government\u2019s **zero-tolerance policy against terrorism**. These hold significance in the context of the prevailing security environment.\n\n* Terrorism emanating from Pakistan has been a consistent challenge whereby terrorist organisations have been devising new methods to threaten the stability of the region.\n* This often included formation of new terrorist outfit by the individuals if their previous organisation was banned. This issue emerged during India\u2019s efforts to designate Masood Azhar as terrorist when some foreign diplomats questioned India\u2019s domestic law which didn\u2019t provide for individual\u2019s designation. Now, declaring an individual as a terrorist will help the government to deal with such situations.\n* Besides, there is growing menace of terror financing and organised crimes like human trafficking, cyber terrorism etc. An empowered NIA is a good step in this direction\n\nHowever, human rights organisations allege that these amendments violate the basic human rights and seek to **create a police state**.\n\n* The UAPA does not clearly define a \u2018terrorist act\u2019.\n* The **presumption of innocence** is considered a universal human rights principle but the UAPA creates a presumption of guilt for terrorist offences based on the seized evidence.\n* Moreover, there is no set procedure for designation as a terrorist. By excluding judiciary and empowering the executive to designate, it dilutes the difference between a terrorist and a terror accused.\n* Similarly, the term **'affecting the interest of India'** in NIA act is undefined and the civil society fears that it can be used to curb freedom of speech and expression.\n\nThus, though the changes are required to meet the prevailing security environment, the policy framework dealing with terrorism must incorporate the state duty to protect against human rights abuses and greater access of victims to remedies. Apart from dealing with terrorism, emphasis should be on to improve the functioing of the police force and to make India\u2019s judicial mechanism faster.",

    "solution": {
      "explanation": "Constitutional morality means adherence to the core principles of the constitutional democracy. In **classicist George Grote\u2019s** perspective, it means \u201cparamount reverence for the forms of the constitution, enforcing obedience to authority and acting under and within these forms, yet combined with the habit of open speech, of action subject only to definite legal control, and unrestrained censure of those very authorities.\u201d\n\n### Constitutional Morality\n\n* In India, the term was first used by **Dr. B.R. Ambedkar** during his **parliamentary debates**. In his perspective, it would mean an **effective coordination between conflicting interests of different people and the administrative cooperation to resolve it amicably** without any confrontation amongst the various groups working for the realisation of their ends at any cost.\n* In **contemporary usage,** it refers to the **substantive content of a constitution**. To be governed by a constitutional morality is to be governed by the substantive moral entailment any constitution carries. In this sense, constitutional morality is the morality of a constitution itself.\n* Its scope is **not limited only** to **following the constitutional provisions** literally but vast enough to ensure the ultimate aim of the Constitution, a socio-juridical scenario providing an opportunity to unfold the full personhood of every citizen, for whom and by whom the Constitution exists.\n* The **sources** of constitutional morality are the text of the **Constitution**, the **Constituent Assembly debates** and the **events** which took place at that period.\n* Constitutional morality is important for constitutional laws to be effective. **Without it,** the operation of a constitution tends to become **arbitrary, erratic, and capricious**.\n* An important case which employed this concept in an innovative manner was **the Naz Foundation Case** which used the concept of constitutional morality to strike down **Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code and decriminalise homosexuality**.\n\n### How does one uphold constitutional morality?\n\n* By letting constitutional morality **guide the Court\u2019s decision** instead of popular morality, while interpreting the constitution.\n* By **locating the content and contours** of constitutional morality so that it is not being ignorantly and dangerously used in courts.\n* By making a **commitment to the values** like constitutional supremacy, rule of law, liberty, equality, parliamentary form of government, self restraint and intolerance for corruption etc.\n* By **using it as an aid in making choices** because it can give another set of clues while searching for constitutional meaning in cases wherein the words of the constitutional clause can be read in different ways.\n* By **having paramount reverence** for the forms of the constitution, enforcing obedience to authority and acting under and within these forms.\n\nEven the constitution itself mentions this concept only four times (twice in Article 19 and twice in Right to religious Freedom under Article 25 and 26), and it has been understudied and ignored for a long while by people in general as well. It needs to be changed in order to understand the constitution with a new perspective  \nexploring further possibilities of this concept.\n\nPublic conscience, moral order and constitutional morality- ethics of politicians, that constitute the core of policy making, must be very sound and strong if democracy is to survive for the long period of progress and prosperity of the people.",

The aim of the exercise is to build bridges between citizens and administration and to streamline administration in tune with the needs of citizens.

It empowered the masses in the following ways:\n\n* Making information accessible to the masses\n* Increased accountability of government for their decisions\n* A tool to ensure curb on corruption\n* It enhanced public trust on the government\n* Efficient working of Government employees.\n* Ensured Impartiality\n\nHowever, The Officials Secret Act (OSA) enacted by the British Government in 1923, to curb down its Enemy States, acts contrary to provisions of RTI. Not only is it anachronistic and lacks usage in a liberal, modern day democracy , it creates obstacles in the implementation of RTI, in the following ways:\n\n* Colonial era act.\n* Majorly used by government to withhold information from citizens by citing security concerns.\n* also used to cover up government impropriety.\n* Used as a draconian weapon of threat against Journalists and activists to unearth governmental shortcomings.\n* Used to silence specific investigations undertaken by citizens or civil society.\n* May lead to wrongful suspicion of spying on citizens eg: S Nambi Narayan,an eminent ISRO scientist, was investigated in the ISRO spy case. He faced a criminal trial under OSA and acquitted now after 24 long years.\n\n**Moreover,**\n\n* Liberal and modern democracy runs on complete participation of citizens in each and every Government decision.\n* There would be no espionage if every information is already available in public domain.\n* Why should government be afraid/concerned, if there is nothing to hide?\n* Why only government get to decide what needs to be kept secret, in a democracy?\n\nHowever, Complete transparency is neither possible nor desirable due to security concerns, especially when India is faced with multifaceted threats on account of being placed in a hostile neighbourhood.\n\n* Classified and sensitive documents on national security issues like Nuclear Installations, Movement of Troops etc. is of little use to the public and also jeopardise the safety of the nation.\n* Espionage concerns cannot be ruled out. Recent theft of design plan of Scorpene Class Submarine is one such example.\n\nDespite, Section 22 of the Right to Information (RTI) Act explicitly stating that it overrides the OSA by forbidding the Government to deny access to a document demanded through an RTI question just on the sole ground that it has been marked secret under the OSA, there needs to be a firmer system in place to differentiate between the use and misuse of OSA. Now, that we have systems like Lokpal at place, so giving an Independent committee the responsibility to curb government\u2019s autonomy on deciding what qualifies as \u201csecret\u201d will be a welcome change.\n\nHence, there is a need to balance secrecy and transparency. As, the Second Administrative Reforms Commission (SARC) Report, 2006, suggested that a culture of secrecy breeds confidentiality, making disclosure a rarity.",

The person loses self respect and trust of his family and children who inculcate such inadequate values from him.\n* **Impact on governance system:** Lack of impartiality in functioning of civil servants has direct impact on their decisions in day to day administration either in public service delivery or implementing social welfare schemes.\n* **Problems in chaotic situations:** Difficult circumstances like communal riots demands officers with strict political neutrality. Biased decisions can lead to loss of lives and property. Hence, a civil servant must be accountable for his decisions in such situations.\n* **Policy paralysis:** Fear of political vendetta against non-cooperative officers in the form of frequent transfers, delay in promotions, etc results in red-tapism and culture of secrecy in their decision making.\n* **Negative impact on civil society:** Civil servants occupying top positions in the government are role models for young aspiring Indians. Their impartial attitude is detrimental to the societal ethics at large.\n\nTherefore, a civil servant must be politically neutral. As a civil servant, one has the responsibility towards public and must adhere to constitutional principles keeping his conscience intact. His primary job is to perform **Nishkama Karma** (selfless and desire less duty). He must be rational, exemplary, and committed to the public  \ncause.\n\nMaterialistic things charms anyone only for short span and in the long run person derive satisfaction by doing his job honestly and making positive contributions in the lives of others. Therefore, civil servants and even politicians should stay away from material gains.\n\nAlso, a civil servant should be ready to serve at any position at any time. Fear of transfer should not refrain a civil servant from his commitment towards public cause and larger interest of society.",

Arms smuggling and money laundering provides easy means of financing their anti-social activities.\n* **Social dimension:** A society ridden with such maladies can never focus on education, health, development, empowerment and welfare which are the key aims of a welfare state.\n* **Economic dimension:** Involvement of people in such activities will lead to the emergence of a black economy eating away at the vitals of a state.\n* **Political and administrative dimension:** Allegedly, local political leaders and senior police officers are hand in glove with the drug mafia and are providing clandestine support to them- which raises the question of moral and ethical propriety.\n\n### Measures to deal with the crisis\n\n* Since the problems have permeated through the social, political and administrative structures, my response, as a lady Superintendent of Police should be calculated, precise and swift, with long term implications in mind.\n* Firstly, a thorough investigation must be conducted within the police establishment to identify the black sheep and they should be subjected to lawful punishment.\n* **Law enforcement:** I would focus on scrupulous and strict implementation of existing laws -taking a cue from *inspirational lady SP of Sonitpur district, Sanjukta Parashar*, who efficiently curbed insurgency, seized tons of illegal arms and ammunition and arrested dozens involved in illegal arms racket.\n* **Taking help from Border Security Forces:** Since my district lies in a frontier state; there is a possibility of involvement of transnational elements. For this, the police force must act in tandem with Border security personnel because with rigorous patrolling and search operations local elements can be isolated.\n* Going beyond just law enforcement, I would also discuss the social dimensions of the problem with other administrative officers like District Magistrate- and suggest to involve other benign actors like NGOs, Panchayat heads etc, acting in a concerted way, for engendering education and addressing the issue holistically.\n* Efforts should also be made to wean off regular farmers if involved in poppy cultivation.\n\nIndia\u2019s frontier districts need to remain economically prosperous, socially in harmony and free of illegal criminal networks because an afflicted district can have long-term adverse implications on the security, unity and integrity of India.",

      "explanation": "When Lord Curzon became the Viceroy of India in 1899, the national movement wasstill in itsinfancy. The Indian National Congress has been established in 1885 and was dominated by the moderates who believed in pleading and petitioning to have their demands met.\n\n### Policies adopted by Lord Curzon\n\n* **Imperialism:** Curzon was a true imperialist and deeply racist, and convinced of Britain\u2019s \u201ccivilising mission\u201d. He was intolerant of Indian political aspirations and his ambition was to strangulate the national movement. He had famously said, \u201cCongress is tottering to its fall, and one of my greatest ambitions while in India is to assist it to a peaceful demise.\u201d\n* **Calcutta Corporation Act, 1899:** The Act reduced the number of the elected representative to the Calcutta Corporation. The aimwasto deprive Indians ofself-governance and serve the interests ofthe European business community who complained of delay in grants of licences.\n* **University Act, 1904:** On the pretext to raise the standard of education all around, the Act reduced the number of elected senate members. A countrywide movement against this Act was launched.\n* **Bengal Partition, 1905:** Bengal was divided, on the pretext of administrative convenience, in two separate provinces. Besidesthe ostensible reason,the real motive wasto check the relentlessly rising nationalism among the Bengalis. Curzon wanted to create fission based on religious identity.\n\n### Implication of Curzon\u2019s policies\n\n* The stepstaken by Curzon to curb political aspirations created resentment and a confrontation with the educated middle-class nationalists ensued.\n* The Swadeshi movement was started in Bengal in 1905 with an appeal to boycott British goods and promote swadeshi. It was probably the first wide-scale movement after the revolt of 1857. The future movements by Gandhiji, such Non-Cooperation were considered to be based on Swadeshi movement.\n* The movement had started on the conventional moderate lines but later it was taken over by the extremists and became a nation-wide anti-colonial movement. Leaders like Tilak, Bipin Pal, Aurobindo Ghose started to dominate the Congress.\n* Later, numerousrevolutionary organisation like Jugantar began to emerge. They actively engaged in anti-colonial activities and instilling nationalism among the youth.\n\nThe partition of Bengal and the high-handed behaviour of Curzon fired the national movement. His policies, contradictory to his beliefs,strengthened and extended the reach of nationalism. He also ended up extending the clout of extremists and revolutionaries who did not believe in pleading and petitioning.",

      "explanation": "The UN Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) defines desertification as land degradation in arid, semi-arid, and dry sub-humid areas resulting from various factors, including climatic variations and human activities. It encompasses far beyond the world\u2019s deserts, defying climate boundaries.\n\nThe vulnerability of land to desertification is mainly due to the climate, the topography, the state of the soil, the natural vegetation, and the ways in which these resources are used.\n\n* **Climate Change:** Changing rain pattern, warming of land temperature, frequent flood and drought are degrading the vegetation of a particular area, thus, gradually leading to desertification.\n* **Loss of Natural Vegetation:** Activities like deforestation, extensive exploitation and grazing of grassland are loosening the soil resulting in soil erosion. Further, soil erosion is a global phenomenon that affects almost all major biomes in the world.\n* **Urbanization:** Urbanization isincreasing at a rapid pace.\u00a0 Even in India, almost 50% ofthe population is expected to live in urban areas, by 2050. As urbanization increases, the demand for resources increases, drawing more resources and leaving lands that easily succumb to desertification.\n\n### Desertification knows no climate boundaries\n\n* According to Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO), desertification affects about two-thirds of the countries of the world and one-third of the earth\u2019s land surface, on which approximately one billion people live.\n* Desertification is a worldwide phenomenon. It does not concern only the natural deserts, and can occur on such lands which are vulnerable to the desertification process.\n* Two-thirds of the African continent is desert or drylands. The region is affected by frequent droughts, which have been particularly severe in recent years in the Horn of Africa and the Sahel.\n* There are expanding deserts in China, India, encroaching sand dunes in Syria, steeply eroded mountain slopes of Nepal and overgrazed grassland in central Asian counties. In terms of the number of people affected by desertification and drought, Asia is the most severely affected continent.\n* Well known for rainforests, Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) are actually about one-fourth desert and drylands. These regions are particularly affected by land degradation, which is a factor in the vicious circle of land overexploitation, degradation, increased demands on production, greater poverty, food insecurity and migration.\n\nAs can be seen from the above arguments, desertification and its impacts are not restricted to certain climatic boundaries. That\u2019s why UNCCD describes desertification as one of the greatest environmental challenges of our time and it must be tackled in a holistic manner.",

      "explanation": "The 1920s was a watershed decade in the history of Indian National Movement. The events and changes which manifested in the decade were seminal as they remarkably changed the course of the freedom struggle.\n\n### Ideologies that influenced freedom struggle\n\n* **Gandhian:** Mahatma Gandhi introduced new techniques of Ahimsa (non-violence) and Non-cooperation to the national movement. The Non-Cooperation Movement in the early 1920s was the first true nation-wide movement.\n* **Communism:** A powerful left-wing group developed in India in the late 1920s and 1930s. The stream of the struggle for independence and that of the struggle for social and economic emancipation of the suppressed began to come together. The establishment of organisations like Communist Party of India (1925), All India Trade Union Congress (1920) and Workers\u2019 and Peasants\u2019 Parties (1927) extended the reach of communism throughout India among workers and peasants.\n* **Communalism:** Post-1922, communalism reared its ugly head and the country was repeatedly plunged into communal riots. Old communal organizations were revived and fresh ones were founded. The Muslim League and Hindu Mahasabha began to further their vested interests.\n* **Revolutionary activism:** The failure of peaceful mediums had frustrated the youth. They began to mobilise with secret organisationslikeHindustan Republic Association (1923) andHindustan Socialist Republic Association (1928). RamPrasad Bismil, Ashfaqulla Khan, Chandrashekhar Azad, Bhagat Singh among others actively engaged in anti-colonial activities and encouraged youth to join the cause.\n\n### Expansion of social base\n\n* Gandhiji for the first time made the national movement a mass movement. People from every background began to participate in the protests. Peasants (Eka movement), tribals(Alluri Sitaram Raju) vigorously engaged in challenging the authority of British rule.\n* Due to this new awakening,the suppressed social classes asserted theirrightin society. Movementslike Vaikom Satyagraha of Kerala (1924), Adi-dharma movement of Punjab (1926) were the outcome of the aspirations of the suppressed and Dalits.\n* Women no longerremained confined to the houses and freedom-fighterssuch as Rajkumari Amrit Kaur, Sucheta Kripalani and Aruna Asaf Ali actively participated and shaped the national movement.\n\nEarlier, the freedom struggle, with a narrow social base, was largely confined to the middle-class and elites. The 1920s witnessed the expansion ofthe social base and people fromevery stratumbegan to associate themselves with it through different ideological dimensions. The participation of masses made the struggle more vibrant and inclusive.",

      "explanation": "Urban flooding has become a common occurrence these days in India. Several cities have suffered catastrophic flooding situations over the past few years. The latest victim of flooding were Hyderabad and Pune. According to recent studies, more than 50% of smart cities in India are prone to floods.\n\n**Some of the most common reasons for frequent flooding in urban India are as below:**\n\n* **Inadequate Drainage Infrastructure:** Cities like Hyderabad, Mumbai rely on a century-old drainage system, covering only a small part of the core city.\n* **Terrain Alteration:** Lasting irreversible damage has been done to the city by property builders, property owners, and public agencies by flattening terrain and altering natural drainage routes.\n* **Reducing Seepage:** Indian cities are becoming increasingly impervious to water, not just because of increasing built up but also because of the nature of materials used which is hard, non-porous.\n* **Lax Implementation:** Even with provisions of rainwater harvesting, sustainable urban drainage systems, etc., in regulatory mechanisms like the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA), adoption at user end as well as enforcement agencies remains weak.\n\n### Lasting Remedial Measures to Counter Floods\n\nCountering urban floods is not possible through one size fits all approach as geological reasons resulting in floods are different for different cities. The following steps can be taken to mitigate the frequent urban flood situations in million plus cities:\n\n* In the case of South Indian cities, especially like Hyderabad and Chennai, flooding takes place mainly due to sudden downpour caused by cyclonic activities. To reduce the events of floods, the need is to clear the critical areas, like waterbodies, from encroachments.\n* In the Himalayan areas, cloud burst events, especially during monsoon season,result in flash floods. To counter the same, check dams, small-scale levees and sandbag embankments need to be developed. Increasing the width and base level of river flow will increase downstream flow and prevent overflowing of rivers.\n* In case of cities like Patna and Kolkata lying in plain areas, the \u2018normal\u2019 riverine floods occur which are comparatively easy to predict and counter. The need is to construct a \u2018sponge city\u2019 with a larger number of gardens, parks, wetlands, and floodplains nearby and use modern technologies to divert surplus water from the city. This will not only recharge depleted aquifers but also prevent the fast-changing hydrology of the rivers.\n\nShortcomings in urban planning and poor coordination among various departments/bodies have resulted in damaging the existing infrastructure of cities which ultimately resultsin flood situations. The government through public-private partnership should try to address the problem at the earliest.",

It also covers the qualifications and disqualifications for the membership of these Houses, the corrupt practices and other election offences.\n\n**Section 123 of RPA, 1951 provides for disqualification on ground of corrupt practices like:**\n\n* Bribery i.e. any gift/offer/promise or gratification to any person as a motive or reward.\n* Undue influence i.e. any direct or indirect interference on part of the candidate with the free exercise of any electoral right.\n* Publication by a candidate any statement of fact which is false.\n* Promotion of feelings of enmity or hatred between different classes of citizens.\n* The incurring of expenditure more than the stipulated limit.\n\n**Procedure of Disqualification under RPA**\n\n* The procedure of disqualification under the corrupt practices can be started only after the election is over and only in an election petition submitted in the State High Court in accordance with the provisions of\u00a0 Article 329 of the Constitution.\n* Section 8 (3) of the Actstatesthat if an MP or MLA is convicted for any other crime and issent to jail for 2 years or more, he/she will be disqualified for 6 years from the time of release.\n* Despite such an elaborate classification of corrupt practices that could potentially nullify the election of a candidate, electoral malpractice continues to flourish.\n\n**Reasons**\n\n* Many of the provisions are extremely difficult to enforce despite an assertive Election Commission.\n* Electoral frauds such as booth capturing and casting of false votes have been drastically reduced, but votebuying and unaccounted campaign expenditure continue unabated.\n  + A study by the Centre for Media Studies found that over the last decade, at least one-fifth of India\u2019s electorate was paid cash for their votes.\n* Besides, the cap on campaign expenditure is often breached by candidates.\n* The petitions are filed before the High Courts, which already have a large number of pending cases. The RPA has mandated that the petitions be disposed of within a period ofsix months, in reality, they drag on for years.\n* The RPAs lack clear provisions and guidelines on the matters related to the misuse of official machinery that gives an unfair advantage to the ruling party.\n\n**Way forward**\n\n* The Law Commission has recommended changing the procedure for hearing election petitions. It said that special election benches should be constituted to dispose of election petitions quickly.\n* It also recommended thatthe President ofIndia should decide the period of disqualification of guilty candidates on the advice of the Election Commission.",

      "explanation": "The basic objective behind the Right to Information (RTI) Act was to empower the citizens, promote transparency and accountability in the working of the Government, contain corruption, and make our democracy work for the people in real sense.\n\n**The recent amendments to the RTI Act**\n\n* The Right to Information (Amendment) Act, 2019 has changed the status, salary and tenure of the Central Information Commissioners (CICs) and State Information Commissioners (SICs).\n* The original Act prescribed salaries, allowances and other terms ofservice of the state CIC as \u201cthe same asthat of an Election Commissioner\u201d, and the salaries and other terms of service of the StateIn formation Commissioners as \u201cthe same as that of the Chief Secretary to the State Government\u201d.\n* The amendment says that these \u201cshall be such as may be prescribed by the Central Government\u201d. Thus, the Centre now has the powers to decide the salaries, term, and service conditions of CICs and SICs.\n\nIt has been argued that the amendments were necessary to correct certain anomalies. For example, the mandate of Election Commission of India and Central and State Information Commissions are non-identical, so should be their status and service conditions.\n\nHowever, the amendments have the potential to impact the autonomy and independence of the Information Commissions.\n\n* Independent structures set up to regulate and monitor the government are vital to a democratic state committed to delivering justice and constitutional guarantees.\n* The amendment allowsthe interference of the executive in the functioning of information commissions which are quasi-judicial bodies. This may affect the doctrine of separation of powers, which underscores this independence and is vital to our democratic checks and balances.\n* Apart from this, the amendment also affects the constitutional principles of federalism, as now the Central government can change terms of service of state information commission.\n* The amendment hasthe potential to make accessto information difficult. Easy and quick accessto information is vital to ensure the accountability of the representatives and the state.\n\nThe 2nd ARC held that RTI is the master key to governance as it checks the misuse and arbitrariness of power and corrupt governance.

      "explanation": "A federation is a political entity characterized by a union of partially self-governing states or regions united by a central government. Granville Austin describes the Indian federation as an example of cooperative federalism that produces a strong Central government but does not result in weak provincial governments. Such distinctive nature of federalism gives rise to cooperation, competition and sometimes confrontation among the federal units.\n\n**Collaboration**\n\n* It was seen during the GST reforms when each state agreed to leave some part of their share in the tax pool for the long-term goods.\n* Collaboration was also evident during the COIVD-19 pandemic when states and the Centre acted as one in the fight against the virus.\n\n**Competition**\n\n* With the Liberalisation Reforms of 1991, there has been a competition among the states to attract foreign investment and industries.\n* Planning Commission was replaced by NITI Aayog to promote competition among states and promote the spirit of cooperative federalism. The NITI Aayog publishes rankings of different states in accordance with Ease of Doing Business and this has led to several states and districts doing reforms at the ground level.\n* The Aspirational Districts Programme (ADP) started by the NITI Aayog aims to identify 115 laggard districts in termsofsocio-economicoutcomesandinstituteaprogrammewithconvergence, collaborationandcompetition as the core tenets.\n\n**Confrontation**\n\n* From 1967 to 1990, India had witnessed confrontational federalism due to the emergence of regional parties.\u00a0The confrontation between States and the Union was due to the role of the governor and the use of Article 356.\n* Politically, the rise of coalition politics increased the role of states at national level. This can be seen in the role of West Bengal in River Sharing Agreement with Bangladesh and of Tamil Nadu during India\u2019s role in conflict with LTTE in Sri Lanka.\n\nThis collaboration, competition and confrontation has shaped the Indian federation. It is visible in following ways:\n\n* The diverse regional aspirations havemanaged to constantly assertthemselves,resulting in the decentralisation of governance in India and the institutionalisation of the Local Self -government under the 73rd and 74th Constitutional Amendment Acts.\n* The passing of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) is anothersuch example. By implementing GST the Centre and States have become equal fiscal partners in sharing a common indirect tax base.\n* The Union government accepted the 14th Finance Commission recommendation to give the States 42% share of the funds from the central pool.\n\nCooperative and competitive federalism are complementary ideas that will drive India\u2019s growth story in the coming decades. However, it is necessary to avoid confrontations among the units of federalism. Inter-state Council can play an enabling role in bringing the Centre and the States together on contentious policy issues.",

      "explanation": "Both India and the United Kingdom are democratic countries with parliamentary form of government. Besides, there are differences as well as similarities on how the Executive, Legislature and Judiciary of these countries function.\n\nThe Indian Judicial System has its origin in the \u2018Mayors Courts\u2019 established by the East India Company in 1726. During the course of the British Rule, the judicial systems developed imbibing the features like rule of law, and recording judicial precedents.\n\nAfter Independence India inherited the same judicial system but made changes to suit the peculiar Indian situation.\n\n**The points of convergence in the judicial system include:**\n\n* **Independence of Judiciary:** In Britain as well as in India the judges can only be removed from the office for serious misbehavior and with the consent of both the Houses of Parliament.\n* **Ultra-vires:** Courts in both the UK and in India can declare the action of executive as ultra-vires i.e. acting or done beyond one\u2019s legal power or authority.\n* **Interpretation of Constitution:** The courts in both India as well as in the UK act as the highest interpreter of the constitution.\n\n**The points of divergence in the judicial system include:**\n\n* **Sovereignty of Parliament:** Under the doctrine of Parliamentary sovereignty, the judiciary in the UK lacks the power to strike down an Act of Parliament. However, in India, the courts have been given this power.\n* **Basic Structure Doctrine:** The courtsin India have come up with the Doctrine of Basic Structure, which prevents executive from making laws or amendments which alter or deviate from the basic values enshrined in constitution.\u00a0 British system lacks the concept of \u2018Basic Structure\u2019.\n* **Unified Three-Tier System:** The United Kingdom does not have a single unified legal system, England and Wales have one system, Scotland another, Northern Ireland a third. The Constitution of India has established a unified three-tier system of judiciary, with the Supreme Court at the top.\n* **Appointment of Judges:** In the UK, the Constitutional Reform Act, 2005 has created the Judicial Appointments Commission for appointment of judges. However, in India, the Judges of the Supreme Court, as well as High Courts, are appointed by the President under collegium system.\n\nThe British judicial system provided the foundation on which its Indian counterpart was built. But Indian judicary has evolved and learnt from the best practices around the world to safeguard democracy and rule of law.",

      "explanation": "The Speaker of the House is a key office in parliamentary democracy. The Speaker facilitates the business of the House and maintains decorum in the House. The Speaker has functions to perform in regulatory, administrative and judicial matters.\n\nHowever, the Speakers have often been alleged to be working under their respective party affiiliations. There have been incidents when the opposition members have been denied chance to raise questions. In a recent case, the demand for recording of votes has been declined by the Speaker and the motion had been passed by voice vote.\n\nSpeakers have also been blamed for harboring political ambitions asthe person elected as Speaker are eligible for further appointment. For example, G.S. Dhillon, Speaker of the Lok Sabha (for two terms), stepped down in 1975, and became the Union Minister for Shipping.\n\nAs a revamp in the structure of the office, the UK practice of Once a Speaker always a Speaker is sometimes suggested. In the United Kingdom, once elected, the Speaker gives up all party affiliations and remains in office until retirement. Political parties do not field candidates from the constituency of the Speaker to ensure his/her re-election to the house. The British Parliament automatically elevates the Speaker to the House of Lords once they demit office.\n\n**Implications of adopting UK system of Speaker in India:**\n\n* The UK system ensures impartiality, fairness and autonomy of the Office of the Speaker.\n* It ensures the freedom from interference and pressures which provide the necessary atmosphere where one can work with absolute commitment to the cause of neutrality as a constitutional value.\n* It also ensures security of tenure.\n* Nevertheless, uncontested re-election impacts representative democracy at the level of constituency.\n* One person at one post for life also prevents bringing new conduct and alternative point of views in the office.\n* The level of autonomy this system provides requires establishment of a similar level of accountability mechanism.\n\nGiven the need for reform for the office of the Speaker in India, it is necessary to strengthen the office of Speaker in India.\n\n* In Ireland, the position of Speaker is given to someone who has built up credibility by relinquishing his or her political ambitions.\n* Speaker can be disallowed from future political office, except that of the President, while being given a pension for life.\n* Issues associated with representative disqualification can be determined by a separate tribunal.\n* The restrictions can be placed on the discretionary powers of the Speaker. These may include imposing deadlines to deal with the cases of resignation or disqualification or floor tests.\n\nIt is time to ensure impartiality and transparency in the office of the Speaker by imposing a deadline and a set of guidelines required to exercise all the entrusted powers. It is only after such changes are put in place that the revered office of the Speaker can truly be called the symbol of India\u2019s freedom and liberty.",

      "explanation": "Institutional quality in a democracy determines how successful the government machinery adheres to the principles of public service, rule of law, and social justice. One such institution is the Civil Services, which acts as a link between the government and citizenry strengthening democracy and furthering economic objectives such as sustainable growth and development.\n\n**Challenges Faced By Civil Services in India**\n\n* **Status Quoist:** As instruments of public service, civil servants have to be ready for change. The common experience, however, is that they resist changes as they are wedded to their privileges and prospects and thereby, have become ends in themselves.\n  + For example, the 73rd and 74thAmendmentsto the Constitution have envisaged democratic decentralization.\n  + However, due to the reluctance on the part of the civil servants to accept the changes in control and accountability, the intended vision has not been achieved.\n* **Rule-Book Bureaucracy:** It means following the rules and laws, in words and not in spirit, without taking care of the actual needs of the people. Due to rule book bureaucracy, some civil servants have developed the attitude of \u2018bureaucratic behaviour\u2019 which brings issues like red-tapism and poor responses to the needs of the people.\n* **Political Interference:** The political representatives for the sake of fulfilling the populist demand, often influence the functioning of administrative officials. This leads to issues like corruption and arbitrary transfers of honest civil servants, an important reason for inefficient implentation of policies.\n\n**Civil Services Reforms**\n\n* **Prompt Delivery of Services:** Every department should seek to simplify their processes to cut administrative delays and ensure participatory feedback mechanisms for efficient service delivery.\n* **Reducing Discretion & Enhancing Accountability Mechanism:** There is aninherent need to set key responsibility/ focus areas and progressively reduce discretionary aspects to evaluate civil servants.\n  + Online Smart Performance Appraisal Report Recording Online Window (SPARROW) should be instituted in all central and state cadres.\n  + Also, as suggested by many committees, there is a need to develop benchmarks to assess the performance of officers and compulsorily retire those deemed unable to meet the benchmarks.\n* **Incorporation of Code of Ethics:** As suggested by 2nd ARC, along with streamlining of code of conduct rules, there is a need to inculcate ethical underpinning in the civil servants by implementing the Code of Ethics. This will sensitize civil servants to the problems of people.\n\nSardar Patel considered the civil service \u201cthe steel frame of government machinery\u201d. However, without adequate reforms, this steel frame may start to get corroded and may collapse.",

      "explanation": "During the Constituent Assembly debates, the prominent members of the assembly asserted a stronger Union government necessary for India\u2019s survival and political stability, given its vast diversity. The Indian Constitution has an inherent bias for the Union government as the central government is the superior authority to the states in various ways.\n\n**Centralising Tendencies of the Constitution**\n\n* Article 1 describes India as a Union of States. That is, an indestructible Union of destructible States.\n* The Union list contains more subjects than the State list and in case of a deadlock between the Union and States over subjects in the concurrent list, the Union law prevails. Further, the residual powers rest with the Union.\n* Provisionslike single Constitution;single citizenship; all-India public services etc. are othersuch manifestations of centralising tendencies.\n* The application of centralising provisions was recently visible as the Union implemented several Acts to fight the Coronavirus, and to reform the agriculture sector.\n\n**Disaster Management Act, 2005**\n\n* It was enacted by the Union under the residual powers. The Act proved to be instrumental in combat against the COVID-19 though \u2018Public health and sanitation\u2019 is a subject under Entry 6 of State list.\n* Under the Act, irrespective of any law in force, the Center can issue any directions to any authority anywhere in India to facilitate or assist in disaster management.\n\n**Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897**\n\n* The Act was formulated pre-independence mainly to control plague in the late 1800s.\n* Under this Act, State governments have the prerogative to take appropriate measures for arresting the outbreak or spread of a contagious disease.\n* During the outbreak of COVID-19, the Union Health Ministry had advised all the states/UTsto invoke provisions of Section 2 of the Act so that all advisories being issued from time to time are enforceable.\n* The Act empowers the Central government to take measures for inspecting and detaining persons travelling out of or into the country during the epidemic.\n\n**The Three Farm Acts**\n\n* The Central government recently introduced major agricultural market reforms through three Acts: The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020, The Farming Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, and The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020.\n* These have been enacted under Entry 33 of Concurrent List which deals with trade and commerce, and production and supply of foodstuffs \u2013 an issue that holds enormous importance for enhancement of farm income.\n* However, these three inter-linked Acts constitute the concerted entry of the Centre into the sphere of agriculture, which was designated a State subject in the Constitution.\n\nThus, a strong Union seems essential for coordinating vital matters of common concern and ensuring peace. Moreover, though there are some centralising tendencies, there also exists some highly federal features like dual polity and bicameral structure of the parliament.",

It has obliged the Government to appropriate the advice of the Rajya Sabha.\n* **Rise of Regional Parties:** Since the 1980s, a rise in the popularity of regional parties was witnessed. It allowed regional parties to have a greater share in the membership of Rajya Sabha, thus enhancing the influence of Rajya Sabha while passing a Bill.\n* **Coalition Governments:** The 1990s brought a new era in Indian polity, an era of coalition government. It required a wider consensus in the enactment of statutes.\n* **Expert or Informed Opinion:** Requirement of expert or informed opinion in matters like Personal Data Protection Bill, Surrogacy Bill, etc. have made the role of Rajya Sabha indispensable.\n\n**The transformation can be seen in:**\n\n* Abrogation of **Article 370,** where the support of Rajya Sabha was vital for the benefit of people of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh.\n* **GST reforms** was another subject where Rajya Sabha\u2019s role was proactive.

In rural India, where the credit market has been traditionally dominated by moneylenders, micro-finance becomes important to serve the credit requirement of poor and end the vicious cycle of debt trap through promoting income-generating activities.\n\n**Micro-Finance: An Anti-poverty Vaccine**\n\n* Microfinance services contribute to the improvement of resource allocation, promotion of markets, and adoption of better technology; thus, microfinance helps to promote economic growth and development.\n* It assiststhe communities of the economically excluded to achieve a greater level of asset creation and income security at the household and community level.\n* It aims to dispense access to the capital to small entrepreneurs.\n* To promote Micro-Finance, the government launched initiatives like NABARD, MUDRA loans, etc. MUDRA providesrefinance support to Banks/NBFCsfor lending to micro units having loan requirements upto 10 lakh Rs.\n\n**Self-Help Groups (SHGs) and Micro-Finance**\n\n* SHGs are informal associations of people who choose to come together to find ways to improve their living conditions. In the last few decades, SHGs have emerged as the most effective mechanism for delivery of microfinance services to the poor in general and women in particular.\n  + The Genesis of SHG in India can be traced to the formation of Self-Employed Women\u2019s Association (SEWA) in 1972.\n* The income-generating and asset creating activities supported by SHGs include piggery farming, ginger cultivation, small business, handicraft and weaving, etc.\n* They have a multiplier effect in improving women\u2019ssocio-economic condition and enhancing theirself-esteem.\n* For instance, Kudumbashree SHG of Kerala has created a three-tier community network which is run by Community Development Societies (CDSs) of poor women.\n  + One of the successful enterprises of Kudumbashree is Caf\u00e9 Kudumbashree, which includes all women-run cafes as well as catering services.\n  + Kudumbashree women run more than 30,000 enterprises and have an annual turnover of 1090 million Rs.\n\nFor equitable and sustainable development in rural India, financial inclusion supported by MFIs plays an important role.

      "explanation": "Potential GDP is one of the theoretical aspects of national income accounting which assumes that an economy has achieved full employment and that aggregate demand does not exceed aggregate supply. Like other national income accounting methods, potential GDP also represents the market value of all goods and services but rather than capturing the current objective state of a nation\u2019s economic activity, it attempts to estimate the highest level of output an economy can sustain over a period.\n\n**Determinants of Potential GDP**\n\n* **Capital Stock:** In an economy, capitalstock isthe plant, equipment, and other assetsthat help with production. The availability of capital stock determines the extent of economic output and potential GDP.\n* **Labor Force:** At any given moment in time, the quantities of capital, land, etc., are typically fixed, but the quantity of labor employed varies. Therefore, in the short-run, Potential GDP depends on the quantity of labor employed, which depends on demographic factors and on participation rates.\n* **Non-accelerating Inflation Rate of Unemployment:** It is the specific unemployment rate at which the rate of inflation stabilizes \u2013 inflation will neither increase nor decrease.\n* Other determinants of Potential GDP are the level of labor efficiency, labor market efficiency, production capacity, sufficient liquidity, government fiscal support, etc.\n\n**Factors Inhibiting India from Realizing its Potential GDP**\n\n* **Negative Output Gap:** A negative output gap occurs when actual output is less than what an economy could produce at full capacity. A negative gap means that there is spare capacity, or slack, in the economy due to weak demand.\n* **Fall in Private Consumption:** Private consumption is the prime component of India\u2019s GDP as it contributes a significantshare to GDP (More than 55%). Indian economy experienced a sharp decline in private consumption expenditure in the past few quarters.\u00a0 Such decline in private consumption de-incentivizes firms in producing more goods, thereby the economy is left with unutilized resources and labor force.\n* **Mounting NPAs of Banks:** The Indian banking system is under the huge burden of NPAs (Non-Performing Assets), which has tremendously reduced banks\u2019 lending capacity.\u00a0 This has severely affected businesses, production houses and particularly the real estate segment. Such liquidity shortages reduce the productive capacity of the economy.\n* **Unemployment:** \u00a0Huge unemployment in India is also one of the major factorsthat inhibitsIndia from realizing its Potential GDP.\n* **Informal Economic Activities:** \u00a0Most of the economic activities in India are informal or unorganized and the size of such unorganized sectors is considerably huge but not accounted for in GDP. Therefore, the value of such an economy is not recorded in the national account book and remained unreleased.\n* **Other Factors:** Weak intellectual property rights, low expenditure on R&D, contract enforcement issues, etc.\n\n**Way Forward**\n\n* Need to work more on the policy levels to generate employment, efficient and cost-effective resource mobilization, to promote export and innovation and to enhance the scope of Make in India Programme.\n* Better wages must be ensured so as to increase private consumption expenditure.\n* The negative output gap in GDP needs to be managed and compensated through various fiscal and monetary policy measures keeping inflation in check.\n* The government needs to bring policies that catalyse rural economic growth.",

      "explanation": "Recently, the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC) has proposed a draft Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) notification 2020, that seeks to replace the current notification which goes back to 2006. EIA is an important process for evaluating the likely environmental impact of a proposed project.\n\n**Environmental Impact Assessment**\n\n* Under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, India notified its first EIA norms in 1994, setting in place a legal framework for regulating activities that access, utilise, and affect (pollute) natural resources.\n* Every development project has been required to go through the EIA process for obtaining prior environmental clearance ever since.\n* It is a process whereby people\u2019s views are taken into consideration for granting final approval to any developmental project or activity.\n\n**Difference between draft EIA notification, 2020 and 2006**\n\n* **Public Consultation Process:** The draft notification provides for a reduction of the period from 30 days to 20 daysfor the public to submit their responses during a public hearing for any application seeking environmental clearance.\n* **Post-facto Approval:** The new draft allowsfor post-facto approval for projects. It meansthat the clearancesfor projects can be awarded even if they have started construction or have been running phase without securing environmental clearances. It was not allowed in the 2006 notification.\n* **Compliance Report:** The 2006 notification required that the project proponent submit a report every six months, showing that they are carrying out their activities as per the terms on which permission has been given. However, the new draft requires the promoter to submit a report only once every year.\n* **Central Government Powers:** Through the draft notification, the central government gets the power to categorize projects as \u2018strategic\u2019. Once a project is considered as strategic, the draft notification states that no information related to such projects shall be placed in the public domain.\n\n**Major concerns regarding the draft EIA 2020**\n\n* Public consultation is exempted in a wide range of areas like modernization of irrigation projects, construction of buildings, standalone flyovers, bridges, national defence, and security projects etc. This provides people a limited scope to be a part of the EIA process.\n* The period of public hearing and obtaining objections has been reduced and that poses a grave problem in areas where access to information is difficult and where people are unaware about the EIA process.\n\nThe new notification is being brought in order to make the process more transparent and expedient by the implementation of an online system, further delegation, rationalization and standardization of the process. But on the other hand, it is also evident that the draft seeks the growth of commercial projects at the cost of the environment.",

Contribution by the mining sector to India\u2019s GDP is only 1.75%. Whereas other countries like South Africa and Australia contribute 7.5% and 6.99%.\n\n**Reasons:**\n\n* Mining is harmful from an environmental point of view. There has hardly been a mining project that did not face opposition on this front.\n* Several tribal communities and Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) fall into the mining zones. Their residence is also threatened by an increase in mining. Their rehabilitation and compensation is another major issue.\n* The auction of a mine is a process where the power rests in the hands of State governments. There might exist ambiguity in the case where there are two different political parties in power at the Center and the State.\n* There are also issues like technological advancements and availability of cheap funds. Lack of these is the major determinant in poor growth of the mining industry.\n* India has majorly been an exporter of raw materials and an importer of finished products made out of those raw materials. As the raw materials are sold at dirt cheap rates, it reflects poorly in the GDP calculations.",

      "explanation": "The period between two world wars was relatively short, yet featured many significant social, political, and economic changes throughout the world. Politically, the era coincided with the rise of communism, starting in Russia with the October Revolution and Russian Civil War, at the end of World War I.\n\n**Challenges to democratic system:**\n\n* The conditions of economic hardship caused by the Great Depression brought about significant social unrest around the world, leading to a major surge of fascism and in many cases, the collapse of democratic governments.\n* In the 1930s the breakdown of the League of Nations, the rise of aggressive dictatorships posed a serious threat to democracy throughout the world.\n* After the Nazis took power and implemented their anti-semitic ideology and policies, the Jewish community was increasingly persecuted. In 1936, Jews were banned from all professional jobs, effectively preventing them from participating in education, politics, higher education and industry.\n* The Spanish Civil War, (1936\u201339) was a military revolt against the Republican government of Spain, supported by conservative elements within the country. When an initial military coup failed to win control of the entire country, a bloody civil war ensued.\n* The name most commonly given to a far-right movement and political party in Romania in the period from 1927 into the early part of World War II. It was ultra-nationalist, anti-semitic, anti-communist, anti-capitalist, and promoted the Orthodox Christian faith. Its members were called \u201cGreenshirts\u2019\u2019 because of the predominantly green uniforms they wore.\n* Fascism also expanded its influence outside Europe, especially in East Asia, the Middle East, and South America. In China, Wang Jingwei\u2019s Kai-tsu p\u2019ai (Reorganization) faction of the Kuomintang (Nationalist Party of China) supported Nazism in the late 1930s.\n\nThe efforts of the League of Nations failed to maintain peace after the first world war. Eventually, Hitler\u2019s invasion of Poland in September 1939 drove Great Britain and France to declare war on Germany, marking the beginning of World War II.",

      "explanation": "Constitutional Morality is defined as the adherence to the principles of the constitutional values. It includes commitment to inclusive and democratic political process. According to Dr. Ambedkar, the concept of constitutional morality implied the harmonious interaction between the governing and governed.\n\nThough the term \u2018Constitutional Morality\u2019 is not found in the Constitution, nevertheless it is rooted in various facets of the Constitution, such as in:\n\n* Preamble (values like justice, liberty, equality and fraternity)\n* Fundamental Rights\n* Fundamental Duties\n* Directive Principles of State Policy\n\nThe doctrine of constitutional morality safeguards and upholds the enforcement of rule of law in the country. It recognizes this distinction and non-homogeneity and promotes diversity, helping to make the society more inclusive. It also promotes people to be an active participant of the system and fight the inequalities and non-constitutional elements.\n\n**The Supreme Court has been vocal about constitutional morality. To illustrate:**\n\n* In the *Krishnamoorthy case* (2015), the Court held that democracy expects prevalence of genuine orderliness, positive propriety, dedicated discipline and sanguine sanctity by constant affirmance of constitutional morality which is the pillar stone of good governance.\n* In *Justice K.S. Puttaswamy case (2018)*, the SC held that constitutional morality ensures that courts must neutralise the excesses of power by the executive and strike down any legislation or even executive action if it is unconstitutional.\n* In the *Government of NCT of Delhi case (2018),* the Court equated constitutional morality to a \u2018second basic structure doctrine\u2019. It said that constitutional morality acts as a check on arbitrary use of power as it implies strict and complete adherence to the constitutional principles.\n* In the *Indian Young Lawyer\u2019s Association case (2018),* commonly known as the Sabrimala case, the Supreme Court bypassed the doctrine of essentiality (the principle protecting the \u2018integral\u2019 religious practices of a community) to uphold the supremacy of constitutional morality.\n\nConstitutional morality is crucial for constitutional laws to be effective. Without constitutional morality, the operation of the constitution tends to become arbitrary. However, the concept of constitutional morality need not be determined by the Supreme Court at every given instance. It is a sentiment that needs to be cultivated in the minds of citizens.",

    "solution": {
      "explanation": "In the recent instances concerning women in judiciary, the Chief Justice of India, N.V. Ramana called for 50% representation of women in the judiciary.\n\nAccording to the latest data on the gender gap in judiciary, it is highlighted that the Supreme Court only has 2 women judges and there has never been a female Chief Justice of India. There are only around 80 women judges out of the total sanctioned strength of around 1100 judges in the higher judiciary.\n\nThe Sustainable Development Goals (SDG 5 and SDG 16, in particular), address the global responsibility of having gender equality and women\u2019s representation in public institutions such as the judiciary. Achieving equality for women judges, in terms of representation at all levels of the judiciary, should be the ultimate goal.\n\nBeing a woman does not limit her critical thinking and capability to render justice. Judicial benches having representation of women give either a new dimension or broader acceptance to legal principle/interpretation.\n\nBy their mere presence, women judges enhance the legitimacy of courts, sending a powerful signal that they are open and accessible to those who seek recourse to justice. The legal profession, as a gatekeeper of equality and as an institution committed to the preservation of rights, should be emblematic of gender equality.\n\nImproving the representation of women in the judiciary is of crucial importance and has to go a long way towards a more balanced and empathetic approach in cases involving sexual violence. Changing the long-established demographics of a court can make the institution more amenable to consider itself in a new light, and potentially lead to further modernization and reform.",

    "solution": {
      "explanation": "Federalism is a system of government in which the power is divided between a central authority and various constituent units of the country. The Constitution clearly provided a threefold distribution of powers between the Union Government and the State Governments.\n\nKnown as India\u2019s premier investigation agency, Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) deals with matters of corruption and major criminal matter. It investigates cases connected to infringement of economic and fiscal laws. The CBI derives its power from the Delhi Special Police Establishment (DSPE) Act, 1946.\n\nAccording to Section 6 of the DSPE Act, the State\u2019s consent is required to extend CBI investigation beyond Union Territories. There are two types of consent for a probe by the CBI:\n\n* **General Consent:** When a State gives a general consent to the CBI, the agency is not required to seek fresh permission every time it enters that State in connection with investigation.\n* **Specific Consent:** When a general consent is withdrawn, CBI needs to seek case-wise consent for investigation from the concerned State government. If specific consent is not granted, the CBI officials will not have the power of police personnel when they enter that State.\n\nHowever, the power of the States to withhold consent to the CBI is not absolute. The CBI can be ordered by the Supreme Court and the high court to investigate a crime without the consent of the State. Moreover, the withdrawal of general consent does not affect pending investigation (*Kazi Lendhup Dorji* case, 1994) or the cases registered in another State in relation to which investigation leads into the territory of the State which has withdrawn general consent.\n\nIn context of federal structure, Police is exclusively a State subject. However, the establishment of CBI under the DSPE Act is an exception as it encroaches upon the State jurisdiction. Federal issues are caused recurrently with the jurisdiction of CBI often coming into direct confrontation with the State police. The existence of different political parties at the State and Central level often leads to a more prominent conflict between the State and Centre over CBI.",

      "explanation": "India follows a bicameral system at both the Centre and State level. Under this system, the State\u2019s legislature is divided into two parts - Legislative Assembly or Vidhan Sabha and Legislative Council or Vidhan Parishad.\n\nThe Legislative Council is the upper house of the State. Its institution is outlined in Article 169 of the Constitution. Presently, only Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Telangana, Maharashtra, Bihar, and Uttar Pradesh have Legislative Councils.\n\n**Formation:**\n\n* As per Article 169, the Parliament can abolish a Legislative Council (where it already exists) or create it (where it does not exist) by a simple majority, if the Legislative Assembly of the concerned State, by a special majority, passes a resolution to that effect.\n* As per Article 171 of the Indian Constitution, the total number of members in the Legislative Council of a State shall not exceed one-third of the total number of members in the Legislative Assembly.\n* The members of the Council are either nominated by the Governor of the state or are indirectly elected. Of the total number of members of the Legislative Council:\n  + 1/3 of members are elected by electorates consisting of the members of local authorities,\n  + 1/12 are elected by electorates consisting of graduates residing in the state,\n  + 1/12 are elected by electorates consisting of persons engaged in teaching,\n  + 1/3 are elected by the members of Legislative Assembly and\n  + the remaining are nominated by the Governor.\n* 1/3 of the members of Legislative Council retire every 2 years.\n\n**Functions:**\n\n* **Legislative:** Non-money bills can be introduced in the Legislative Council. When a non-money bill, passed by the Legislative Assembly, comes to the Legislative Council, the latter can pass it or can send it back with amendments to the Legislative Assembly for its reconsideration.\n* **Financial:** The Legislative Council has only limited powers in financial matters. A money bill cannot be introduced in the Legislative Council. It can be introduced only in the Legislative Assembly.\n* **Control over Executive:** The Legislative Council does not have much control over the executive. The Council of Ministers is responsible to the Legislative Assembly. Even if the government is defeated in the Legislative Council, it is not bound to resign.\n* **Miscellaneous:** The Legislative Council elects its own Chairman and Deputy Chairman. The Council discusses technical matters as there are experts as its members.\n\nThe legislative power of the Councils is limited. They lack a constitutional mandate to shape non-financial legislation. Besides, the Assemblies can override suggestions/amendments made to legislation by the Council. Critics of Legislative Councils state that the Councils act as a burden on the State budget and are used to park leaders who have not been able to win an election.\n\nNevertheless, the Legislative Councils serve some useful purposes. They act as a check against hasty legislation passed by the Assemblies. They also accommodate election shy talent.That is, the elderly, experienced and sober individuals, who cannot-bear the ordeal of electioneering get onboarded to the Council. For example, Bihar Chief Minister is a member of the Legislative Council.",

The term of office of these Committees is not more than one year.\n\nThe Committees have often been found keeping the administration on its toes thereby setting a benchmark of parliamentary control. This can be ascertained from the functions of such Committees, viz.:\n\n* They examine the demands for grants of the related ministries/departments and report thereon.\n* They verify bills, belonging to the related ministries/departments, referred by the Chairman or the Speaker.\n* Laying importance on the long-term plans and policies guiding the working of the executive, these committees give necessary direction, guidance and inputs for broad policy formulations.\n* They facilitate input from experts and those who may be directly affected by a policy or legislation.\n\n**Nevertheless, the functioning of the Committees is marred with several issues, such as:**\n\n* The meetings happen behind closed doors leading to the issue of transparency.\n* The Committees\u2019 suggestions are not enforceable in nature.\n* It is not necessary to route all the bills to the Committees. Thus, proper scrutiny of all the bills is not guaranteed.\n* The Committees can hardly be considered a specialised body as their tenure is just of one year.\n\nThus, though it is comparatively less difficult to examine an issue in depth by a committee of 30 than by an assembly of 700, the issues faced by these Committees limits their scope.",

      "explanation": "Digital literacy is the ability to navigate the digital world. It focuses on using technology \u2013 like a smartphone, PC, e-reader, etc. \u2013 to find, evaluate, and communicate information. Digital literacy can play a powerful role in helping people connect, learn, engage with their community, and create more promising futures.\n\nIt has been reported that Information and Communication Technology (ICT) in rural areas have slow uptake due to the low to no income, lack of ICT infrastructures, cultural differences, and many other reasons.\n\nDigital illiteracy in the present time of the pandemic has hindered socio-economic development to a great extent in rural areas. It can be concluded so by:\n\n* Children are not able to access quality education or attend virtual classrooms due to issues with internet connectivity coupled with frequent internet/electricity outages.\n* Lack of digital knowledge among rural youth kept them away from capitalising on myriad of employment and income generation opportunities. For example, e-commerce, IT services, etc.\n* Emphasis on digitisation and computerisation, while ignoring digital literacy, led to inaccessibility of government benefits and schemes to the vulnerable sections.\n* Digital illiteracy among women and girl-child in rural areas has increased the gender imbalance. Social, cultural, and institutional barriers influence digital inclusion.\n\nThe digital divide is more than just an access issue and cannot be alleviated merely by providing the necessary equipment. The Standing Committee on Information Technology in January, 2019 concluded that the digital literacy efforts of the government are far from satisfactory.\n\nThe government needs to focus on information accessibility, information utilisation and information receptiveness. Various initiatives such as Digital India, Internet Saathi Program**,** DIKSHA, etc. are commendable steps that are leading to positive socio-economic development in rural areas.",

India became a permanent member of the SCO in 2017.\n\nSCO aims to strengthen relations among member states. But India-Pakistan-Russia-China relations create a complex matrix of diverging and conflicting interests. To illustrate, China has shown little respect to an international rule-based order. \u2018Chequebook\u2019 and \u2018wolf warrior\u2019 diplomacy, human rights violations, etc. raise fundamental questions on Chinese commitments to aims and objectives of SCO. Moreover, under the guise of economic co-operation, China has pushed its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) projects through SCO.\n\nLikewise, SCO seeks to safeguard regional peace, security, and stability. But, China (in Taiwan, Hong Kong, Ladakh), Russia (in Ukraine) and Pakistan (in Jammu & Kashmir) are accused of destabilising the regional peace, security, and stability.\n\n**Importance of SCO for India:**\n\n* SCO is part of India\u2019s stated policy of pursuing \u201cmulti-alignments\u201d and \u201cstrategic autonomy\u201d.\n* The challenges of terrorism, radicalism, and instability pose a grave threat to Indian sovereignty and integrity. SCO\u2019s counter-terrorism body, the Regional Anti-Terror Structure (RATS), may prove useful for India in this context.\n* SCO allows India to deepen its strategic reach in Central Asia. India already has substantial soft power potential in Central Asia. India\u2019s membership of SCO can boost energy security by providing access to mineral and energy resources of the Central Asian countries.\n* India\u2019s presence in the SCO will help in India\u2019s aim to link itself to the larger Eurasian region, and to Europe via INSTC.\n* SCO membership will also help India, which is currently boxed in the South Asian region, to become a major pan-Asian player.\n* SCO can play a vital role in deepening people-to-people engagement through cooperation in the field of education, medicine, tourism, etc.\n\nIndia\u2019s relations with countries in the region have enormous potential for enhancing ties in areas such as economy, security, policy, investment, trade, connectivity, energy, and capacity building. However, India\u2019s benefits from the SCO will be limited due to the role of China and Pakistan in the organisation. Positive outcomes will depend on how Indian diplomacy deals with its rivals.",

      "explanation": "AUKUS is a trilateral security partnership between the United States of America, Australia and the United Kingdom in the Indo-Pacific region. Under the AUKUS alliance, the UK, the US and Australia seek to increase the development of joint capabilities and technology sharing.\n\nCreation of the AUKUS is an attempt to send a stronger message to China as it will give its members a credible deterrence powers towards China by deepening military capabilities. It will also enhance the patrolling and surveillance power of the members in Indo-Pacific, thus restoring the sanctity of norms and rules-based order in the region. By providing nuclear submarines to Australia, it will enhance its capabilities to project power in the Indo-Pacific.\n\nHowever, critics allege that AUKUS is also likely to supersede the existing partnership in the region. For example, the Quadrilateral Dialogue (QUAD) comprising India, Japan, Australia and the US may get lesser importance as the US might be obliged to share its strength and competence to AUKUS and QUAD both. AUKUS may also weaken the Five Eyes alliance group and the ASEAN centrality in the region.\n\nOn the stronger side, the focus of AUKUS will be on integrating all defence and security-related science, supply chains, industrial bases, and technology. The partnership would also involve a new architecture of meetings and engagements between the three countries and cooperation across emerging technologies like AI, quantum technologies, and undersea capabilities.\n\nWith respect to India, AUKUS may instigate a nuclear/conventional arms race in the Indo-Pacific region. It may lead to China and Russia supplying sensitive defence technologies to other states. With its exclusionary vision, AUKUS may also run contrary to India\u2019s vision of an inclusive Indo-Pacific. AUKUS was formulated ignoring France, which may increase trust deficit between the like-minded democratic countries on other matters of global importance.\n\nThus, though AUKUS offers the advantage of balance of power, strategic autonomy, and a check on Chinese aggression, it also has significant challenges as it has been termed as Indo-Pacific NATO. India\u2019s diverse relationships with the West must be deployed in full measure to prevent a split in the Indo-Pacific coalition.",

      "explanation": "An earthquake is the shaking of the earth caused due to the release of energy which generates waves that travel in all directions. Earthquake hazards can range across ground shaking, surface rupture, landslide, liquefaction, tectonic deformation, tsunami etc.\n\n**India is prone to earthquakes because:**\n\n* The landmass is penetrating into the Eurasian plate, which makes the country prone to earthquakes of moderate to very high intensity.\n* Densely populated areas, extensive unscientific constructions and unplanned urbanisation have increased risks.\n* Regions in Himalayan foothills are vulnerable to liquefaction and landslides due to earthquakes.\n\n**Major disasters caused by earthquakes over last three decades:**\n\n* **1993, Latur**: Relatively shallow depth caused large surface damage; causes remain debatable due to lack of plate boundaries in the region.\n* **1999, Chamoli**: Caused by the thrust fault; resulted in landslides, changes in surface water flow, surface rupture and disconnected valleys.\n* **2001, Bhuj**: Associated with a reactivated fault, which was previously unknown; impeccable loss of life and property.\n* **2004, Indian Ocean Tsunami**: Created by under-water seismic activity, created massive waves which flooded coastal areas and islands, causing long-term changes.\n* **2005, Kashmir**: Caused by severe upthrust of Indian plate against Eurasian plate, it created multiple after-shocks. Infrastructure and communication were disrupted.\n\nIndia has come a long way on the road to earthquake safety. And yet, much remains to be done before this journey is completed. Creating a system and culture for building safe houses in 21st century India is something not only possible but an absolute necessity.",

      "explanation": "Infrastructure investments are a form of \u201creal assets\u201d which contain physical assets one sees in everyday life like bridges, roads, highways, sewage systems or energy. Such a type of asset is quite vital in a country\u2019s development. Often, investors invest in infrastructure as it is non-cyclical and it offers stable and predictable free cash flows.\n\n**Benefits of investment in infrastructure:**\n\n* **Stable and Steady Cash Flows**: The potential for steady cash flows is one of the main attractive features of investment in infrastructure. It creates steady and predictable cash flows, given that the asset often comes with a regulated and contracted revenue model.\n* **Non-Cyclical**: While the small Italian restaurant at the corner of the street may go bankrupt during a long economic recession, that same risk does not apply to infrastructure assets. Infrastructure assets are crucial to a country\u2019s development which also means that they will still be used regardless of what stage the economy is in.\n* **Low Variable Costs**: Infrastructure comes with extremely small marginal costs per use which are completely negligible.\n* **High Leverage**: Leverage is the amount that is taken on. Given that infrastructure provides stable and predictable cash flows, it can take on high levels of leverage which leads to high-interest costs.\n\n**Role of infrastructure in rapid and inclusive economic growth:**\n\n* **Creation of Jobs**: Infrastructure development such as road construction, real estate, railway construction, etc. is labour-intensive resulting in increase in employment opportunities in formal and informal sectors and, thus, propelling domestic demand.\n* **Farmer Income**: Investment in infrastructure would play a crucial role in ensuring doubling of farmers\u2019 income through emphasis on increased irrigation infrastructure and storage, processing and marketing infrastructure.\n* **Health and Well-Being**: Infrastructure enhancement of superior healthcare facilities, electronic health records and better equipped health infrastructure at primary levels (Telemedicine).\n* **Logistic Cost**: Establishing world class roads, railways, ports and inland waterways will cut down logistic costs and improve competitiveness and promote exports. This would bring more revenues to the government and may promote socio-economic development.\n\nIndia has been quite attentive with respect to infrastructure programmes. Setting up of a Development Finance Institution (DFI) with an initial capital of Rs. 20,000 crores, is expected to serve as a catalyst for facilitating infrastructure investment. Likewise, the National Infrastructure Pipeline seeks to boost the country\u2019s spending on infrastructure.\n\nHowever, the success of the infrastructure expansion plan would depend on other stakeholders of the pipeline playing their due role. These include State governments and their public sector enterprises and the private sector. Besides, there shall be proper implementation of holistic reforms in the banking sector.",

The company announced this achievement and also indicated that soon the product will be made available for the domestic consumers with almost same quality and health benefits. Accordingly, the company got its product approved by the domestic competent authority and launched the product in Indian market. The company could increase its market share over a period of time and earn substantial profit both domestically and internationally. However, the random sample test conducted by inspecting team found the product being sold domestically in variance with the approval obtained from the competent authority. On further investigation, it was also discovered that the food company was not only selling products which were not meeting the health standard of the country but also selling the rejected export products in the domestic market. This episode adversely affected the reputation and profitability of the food company.**  \n**(a)\u2002What action do you visualise should be taken by the competent authority against the food company for violating the laid down domestic food standard and selling rejected export products in domestic market?**  \n**(b)\u2002What course of action is available with the food company to resolve the crisis and bring back its lost reputation?**  \n**(c)\u2002Examine the ethical dilemma involved in the case.**",

      "explanation": "**(a) Following actions should be taken by the competent authority against the food company for violating food standards:**\n\n* It should be directed to take back all substandard products already launched in the market and should be made to pay adequate compensation to consumers.\n* Proportionate punitive action should be taken as per the provisions of Food Safety and Standards Act.\n* Additionally, the company should also be asked to contribute a significant amount of money in campaigns for raising public awareness on FSSAI norms.\n\n**(b) Course of action available with the food company to resolve the crisis and bring back its lost reputation:**\n\n* Fully cooperate in investigation and serve punishments prescribed by the law for selling substandard food products.\n* Order an external audit by a reputed organisation to pinpoint the fault and fix accountability within the organisation.\n* The top management of the company should tender a public apology and come clean on what went wrong and what remedial actions are being taken. This will assure the public that management is serious about the issue.\n* Ensure that the planned course of action is adhered to and periodically monitor the progress.\n\n**(c) Ethical dilemmas involved in the case:**\n\n* **Shareholder\u2019s Profit vs Heath of Consumer:** This dilemma would have been faced by the food product company. It might have prioritised profit of the shareholders over the health of the consumer. This was a bad decision as ultimately both were affected.\n* **Long vs Short Term Gain of Shareholders:** Selling substandard food might have increased profit for the company and hence shareholders in the short term, however because of tarnished reputation, shareholders will be facing a long-term loss in revenue term.\n* **Standard for Domestic vs International Consumers:** The company would have arrived at the conclusion that rejected products do not meet domestic standards because standards were too high. In their opinion, food products were still safe. However, if this was the case, the company should have raised this technical point with the regulator and tried to get the standard rationalised instead of breaching the law.\n* **Law vs Public Trust:** Cases like this might create trust deficit between the whole food product industry and the consumers. This may hurt the economy and lead to employment loss for many. However, the regulator did well to take a long-term view and followed the law. Eventually the public will trust the system if only it knows that the regulator is keeping an eye on the quality of the product.",

Thus, SC imparted constitutionality to right to pollution free environment.\n* **Polluters Pay Principle-** In **M. C.

This enabled that now hazardous industries will be liable for environmental damage.\n* **Right to Clean Air-** To ensure right of citizens to have clean air, SC introduced Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) in Delhi and NCR region in M. C. Mehta case vs Union of India (2020) which ensured gradually curbing the industrial activities as pollution level peaks.\n* **Right to Compensatory Afforestation-** The SC under it established Compensatory Afforestation Management and Planning Authority (CAMPA) to prevent the misuse of funds raised for afforestation, which inevitably resulted in legislation on the CAMPA Act 2016.\n\nThus, SC as guardian of fundamental rights has effectively employed the provision of laws and judicial pronouncement to protect citizens right to environment as fundamental right under Right to dignified life.",

    "solution": {
      "explanation": "The Right of movement and residence throughout the territory of India is one of the most important fundamental rights available to the citizens of India.\n\nArticle 19(1)(d) of the Indian Constitution entitles every citizen to move freely throughout the territory of the country. Moreover, it is available only to the citizens and to shareholders of a company but not to foreigners or legal entities like companies or corporations, etc.\n\nFreedom of movement has two dimensions \u2014 internal and external. Article 19(1)(d) protects only the internal dimension, i.e., the right to move withing the country.\n\nRestrictions on this freedom can only be imposed on two grounds which are mentioned in Article 19(5) of the constitution itself, namely, the interests of the public and the protection of interests of any Scheduled Tribe.\n\nArticle 19(1)(e) provides the right \u201cto reside and settle in any part of the territory of India\u201d to the Indian citizens. Just like Article 19(1)(d), this right is also subject to reasonable restrictions.\n\nHowever, these rights are not absolute. For example, for protecting the interests of the Scheduled Tribes in India, various provisions have been enshrined in the Fifth and Sixth Schedule of the Indian Constitution. Some of these deal with the limitation or prohibition of the transfer of land in such areas as well as the regulation of the allotment of land.\n\nFurther, in the State of Uttar Pradesh v. Kaushaliya (1963), the Supreme Court held that the right of movement of prostitutes may be restricted on the grounds of public health and in the interest of public morals.\n\nThus, this right, while enhancing the mobility of the Indian citizens, is also subject to certain restrictions that help in maintaining a fine balance between freedoms and rights of the people.",

      "explanation": "The Representation of the People Act, 1951 provides for the conduct of elections. This Act also lays down the procedure for settling disputes arising out of elections.\n\nTo decide election disputes, the procedure begins with filing an election petition inquiring into the validity of the Parliamentary or local government elections\u2019 result. The petition shall be filed in the respective High Court by any candidate, or an elector related to the election personally. Moreover, an election petition calling in question an election shall be filed within 45 days from the results declaration date.\n\nThe election of a particular candidate can be declared void if the High Court opines that:\n\n* On the date of his/her election a returned candidate was not qualified or was disqualified to be chosen to fill the seat.\n* Any corrupt practice has been committed by a returned candidate.\n* There was an improper acceptance of any nomination.\n* There has been any improper reception, refusal or rejection of any vote or the reception of any vote which is void.\n* There has been any non-compliance with the provisions of the Constitution or RPA.\n\nCertain remedies are available to the aggrieved parties against the order(s) of the High Court. The aggrieved party can file an appeal to the Supreme Court within 30 days from the order of the High Court.\n\nIn the Azhar Hussain v. Rajiv Gandhi case (1985), the election petition by Azhar Hussain was dismissed both by the High Court and the Supreme Court due to a lack of evidence substantiating the allegation of corrupt practices by the returning candidate.\n\nAn application for a stay on the High Court\u2019s order can be made to the High Court. The Supreme Court can also put a stay on the operation of the order made by the High Court based on the aggrieved party\u2019s appeal.\n\nFor example, in the Indira Gandhi v. Raj Narain case (1975). Her election was initially voided by the Allahabad High Court on charges of corrupt practices. She later appealed to the Supreme Court which upheld her election.\n\nThus, the Representation of the People Act, 1951 is crucial for the efficient functioning of the Indian democracy as it enables the conduct of streamlined elections and provides the necessary redressal mechanism to the aggrieved parties involved.",

      "explanation": "Centralisation means concentration of decision making and planning at one unit so as to bring in uniformity in the process. It often means consolidation of power or authority. State autonomy refers to degree of control over resources independent of any central authority. There has been tussle between the national and regional political parties over issues such as development, representation at forums and finances.\n\nPolitical parties are recognised as national parties or state parties depending upon their performance in general election of Lok Sabha or Vidhan Sabha. The conditions for being listed as a national or a state party are specified under the Election Symbols (Reservation and Allotment) Order, 1968.\n\n**National Political Parties favour centralisation**\n\n* To achieve uniformity in goals and objectives of political parties\n* To have better control over party cadre members\n* To achieve uniformity in programme of political parties\n* To better target the public at large\n* To better their chances of winning upcoming elections\n\nHowever, centralisation is generally associated with annihilation of regional parties and regional issues and gives prime importance to issues concerning national security. It often demands obedience, overlook accountability and transparency. Thus, centralisation should not overlook the regional issues like development of region, employment etc.\n\n**Regional parties favour state autonomy**\n\n* Regional parties are formed on the lines of identity, statehood, ethnicity, development.,\n* They are in close proximity with the local issues, needs and demands\n* They are against the bureaucratic bottleneck\n* To fasten the decision making at ground level\n* To better mobilise resources according to the need of population\n* To better their ambition of becoming national parties\n\nRegional parties in India are of opinion that regional issues are different from national issues. However, rise in regional parties has also led to another problem of horse trading of members which has pushed the state\u2019s demand for autonomy and development at backseat for certain political gains. This is unhealthy for any democracy. Thus, it is necessary that demand of regional parties are aligned with unity and integrity of India.",

      "explanation": "**British vs Indian parliament**\n\n* While Britain follows the concept of parliamentary supremacy, with its legislative body exercising absolute sovereignty over the nation, India follows a system of constitutional sovereignty with the Constitution being over and above, even the Parliament.\n* Upon passing of a bill by the UK\u2019s parliament, the monarch\u2019s approval is taken only as a formality. While in the case of India, the President has powers to return a bill for reconsideration or withhold assent.\n* UK allows the PM to be elected only from the House of Commons, thereby ensuring a proper representation of the people's choice. Whereas in India, the PM can be selected from either house which, in the case of the Rajya Sabha, would not mean a true representation of the country's electoral choice.\n* A lack in parliamentary sovereignty is evident in the existence of a separate parliament of Scotland within the UK. As opposed to this, in India, even when the special status of Jammu & Kashmir was present, there is a single Parliament.\n\nWhile India is often believed to have a system congruent to the Westminster model, a closer look reveals stark differences between the two, as seen in the case of parliamentary sovereignty.",

Only **25% of bills** were referred to committees in the 16th Lok Sabha, compared to **71% in the 15th.**\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nWhile the cabinet system has changed power dynamics, parliamentary supremacy is constitutionally protected with Parliament **retaining essential powers like no-confidence motions (Article 75)**. The repeal of **farm laws in 2021** shows that Parliament can effectively check executive power, highlighting the need for balance between governance and oversight.",

This will enhance e-transparency and empower citizens through the effective use of electronic platforms and social media, making services clear and accessible to all.",
