      "explanation": "Indus Water treaty was signed in 1960 by then Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and then Pakistan President Ayub Khan, the treaty allocates 80% of water from the six-river Indus water system to Pakistan. India got control over the rivers Beas, Ravi and Sutlej whereas Pakistan got control over Indus, Chenab and Jhelum. India could use the water from Indus, Chenab and Jhelum for non consumptive purposes. A Permanent Indus Commission solves disputes arising over water sharing. The Treaty also provides arbitration mechanism to solve disputes amicably.\n\n**Its implications in changing bilateral relations**\n\n* About 65% area of Pakistan, including the entire Punjab province, is a part of the Indus basin. The water from Indus is important for the country for irrigation, drinking and other purposes. India\u2019s decision to abrogate the treaty would affect Pakistan severely. Pakistan may face drought-like conditions.\n* To deter India from employing its water leverage, the anxiety of Chinese retaliation has been invented. The main Indus stream and the Sutlej, originated in Tibet and collect their main water in India.\n* India at present enjoys a moral high ground because it respects all its treaties with the neighbouring countries. The decision to abrogate the treaty would make other smaller neighbours uneasy.\n* The China may take similar actions in future in case of conflict. Indus originates in China and if the country decides to divert the Indus, India would lose over 35% of its river water.\n* The treaty has been brokered by World Bank. Abrogating the treaty may lead to Pakistan taking India to international dispute settlement agencies.\n* It would affect India\u2019s chances of diplomatically isolating Pakistan.\n* India may face environmental challenges if it decides to scrap the treaty and starts building dams etc. Since river flows through earthquake prone region.\n\nHence, before taking a decision on such an important international treaty with huge diplomatic, environmental and security repercu-ssions, India should weigh in all pros of cons and take a practical view.",

      "explanation": "India started following the \u2018Look East Policy\u2019 in the early 1990s when at the end of the cold war it sensed a change in the locus of world economic power from \u2018west\u2019 to the \u2018east\u2019. It focused on strengthening ties between India and the ASEAN countries by increasing economic and commercial ties. Over the years, it also focused on strategic and security aspects in the East and South East Asia region. Eg: South China Sea.\n\nUnder the strategic thrust of this policy, India firmed up strategic relations with the countries of ASEAN and East Asia through extensive consultations on regional and global security issues and consistent cooperation in defence sector. India\u2019s strategic vision for the East extends to the whole of Asia-Pacific region as India has manifested both its willingness and capability to play a critical role in the emerging strategic dynamics and architecture for this region.\n\nThe Free Trade Agreement (FTA) between ASEAN and India has helped in deeper economic integration. ASEAN is India's fourth largest trading partner. Further, RCEP and FTA for Investments and Services will bolster economic engagements between the two. With the economies of India and the ASEAN growing and their energy needs going up, maritime security and enhanced cooperation in combating terrorism and piracy also become concern areas.\n\nIndia further bolstered its Look East Policy with the announcement of the \u2018Act East Policy\u2019 in 2014, through which it seeks to revive and reinvigorate its relationship with ASEAN and expand beyond the region to encompass Koreas, Australia, New Zealand, Bangladesh as well as countries in the Far East. Now, instead of merely \u2018looking\u2019, India is \u2018engaging\u2019 and \u2018acting\u2019 with East.",

This is evident from China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) which has potential to emerge as a threat to India.\n* China\u2019s deepening relation with South Asian countries, where China is involved in infrastructure building, poses significant challenge to India\u2019s position in the region. At present China has more say in this region where India had strong hold in the past.\n\nChina\u2019s rising economic influence in Asia will allow Beijing to spread its influence in the entire region, which could be used to India\u2019s detriment. In face of these challenges, India\u2019s policy response must focus on building indigenous military power and forging regional cooperation at the same time.",

      "explanation": "Indian economy is one of the fastest growing major economy in the world. To sustain the high economic growth of around 8% in the coming decades, energy security is of paramount importance to India. Despite India\u2019s efforts to develop its domestic energy capacity, it is dependent on imports for 80% of its oil needs, of which roughly 55% is sourced from the Persian Gulf region and more than 80% of gas supplies. This highlights the need for energy policy cooperation with the resource rich West Asian countries. Consequently, India has adopted a \u2018Look West\u2019 or \u2018Link West\u2019 policy in this regard.\n\nSaudi Arabia is India\u2019s second largest source of oil. Iraq is also a major source of Indian energy imports. Further, the energy imports from Iran picked up in the recent past after the easing of sanctions by US. India has also enhanced its bilateral engagement with countries like Oman and UAE and also at institutional level with GCC (Gulf Cooperation Council).\n\nThough countries such as Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Iran, Iraq and Qatar will continue to be its major suppliers of oil and gas, India is trying to walk the diplomatic tight rope in West Asia by partnering with Israel in its Leviathan natural gas filed in the East Mediterranean Sea.\n\nIndia\u2019s energy relation with West Asian countries are intricately related with the Central Asian countries. Thus India has developed Chabahar port in Iran to access the Central Asian energy market. Besides energy infrastructure projects like TAPI gas pipeline and International North South Corridor will have ripple effects on the India\u2019s energy engagements with the West Asian Nations.\n\nIndia\u2019s energy policy engagement with the West Asian region is also related to providing maritime security in the region as most of the shipping vessels pass through Persian Gulf and Indian Ocean. Other major powers like China have increased its footprint in the region. Thus India must also take stock of this geopolitical game in order to secure its own energy security.",

      "explanation": "Public Policy involves balancing the interest of various competing stakeholders and sectors. This at times leads to policy contradiction among various sectors and stake holders causing inadequate \u2018protection and prevention of degradation\u2019 to environment.\n\nFollowing illustrations clearly illustrate this:\n\n1. **Sardar Sarovar Project -** While farmers in arid areas of Gujarat and Rajasthan as well as the industrial sector welcomed this project, there was strong resistance from the tribals who were displaced and were critical of the inadequate rehabilitation process. This project has been criticised for environmental damage like loss of forests and terrestrial biological diversity \u2013 thus displaying the contradictions between two imperatives of environmental protections and developmental needs.\n2. **In Ken Betwa link project -** This project is immensely beneficial meeting the irrigation and drinking water need of the Bundhelkahnd region. However, project is criticised due to its adverse impact on the ecology of both the rivers and damaging biodiversity - by submerging parts of Panna National Park.\n3. **Bt cotton -** The seed manufacturer, Monsanto, wants to enhance its revenue by increasing the area under cultivation of BT Cotton crop. Similarly, farmers also prefer to use these seeds for increasing production and hence their income. There is also arguement that GM crops can fulfil India\u2019s nutritional needs. However there are various reported environmental consequences of Genetically Modified (GM) crop \u2013 such as possibility of emergence of super pest; super weeds as well as potential health hazards of GM crops.\n\nGiven the above examples, various sectors and their stake holders need to work in coordination - keeping in mind the developmental and environmental issues for present as well as future generations.",

Also control over Central Asian hinterland provides strategic supremacy over peripheral regions such as Persian Gulf.\n\nAs a result, major powers like US have military bases in region while China through Belt and Road Initiative is building connectivity projects to Europe through the region. But India also has huge stake in the region as it is important for India\u2019s ambition as regional power, securing energy and trade transit needs. Its importance is evident from India\u2019s joining the Ashgabat Agreement.\n\n**Joining Ashgabat Agreement will:**\n\n* Enable India to utilize the existing transport and transit corridor to facilitate trade and commercial interactions with the Eurasian region through better integration with Eurasian Economic Union and Shanghai Cooperation Organization.\n* Increase scope of Chabahar to become a vital gateway and the shortest land route to Central Asia.\n* Provide access to high-value minerals of Central Asia.\n* Increase India\u2019s trade with Central Asia which is currently over $1 billion - only 0.11% of Central Asia\u2019s trade.\n* Sychronize the existing trade corridors with International North\u2013South Transport Corridor (INSTC) \u2013 complimenting India\u2019s efforts for enhanced regional connectivity and accessibility.\n\nTherefore, Ashgabat Agreement acts as a India\u2018s doorway to Central Asia - thereby providing accessibility for trade, energy security and strategic balance to global power politics.\n\n**Additional Information**\n\nAshgabat Agreement - A multimodal international agreement aiming at the establishment of Transport and Transit corridor between Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Oman and Iran and enhance connectivity within the Eurasian region.",

      "explanation": "World Trade Organization (WTO) officially commenced in 1995 after replacing the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). WTO intends to supervise and liberalize international trade. But recent trade wars, initiated by USA with China, India and other countries, evoke the need of reform in WTO if it has to survive in the present context. The key areas of reforms are:\n\n* **Dispute Settlement System:** There are suggestions regarding bringing transparency, shortening of time frames, permanent panel body, special and differential treatment for developing countries etc. India can benefit from the reforms if proposals specific to developing countries are accepted\n* **Reducing Trade Costs:** Though WTO has come out with Trade Facilitation Agreement (TFA) in this regard, but it mainly addresses the trade of goods. India being a major service provider would benefit if reforms are carried out in trade facilitation of services. It is expected that there are considerable economic benefits from the better movement of people across borders.\n* **Modalities of Negotiations:** Some progress has been made, as the \u2018single undertaking\u2019 nature of negotiations is all but discarded. There are proposals to make them more flexible.\n\nIndia is one of the prominent members of WTO and is largely seen as leader of developing and under developed countries. More than 40% Indian economy is exposed to international trade. If we want to achieve a double-digit growth over a sustained period and create jobs, our external trade has to grow at more than 15% a year, which is not possible in an uncertain trading environment. Therefore, India should call upon all WTO members, including the US, to undertake a systemic reform in the above-stated crucial areas of the WTO\u2019s functioning.",

      "explanation": "Gandhara art is a style of Buddhist visual art that developed between the 1st century BCE and the 7th century CE in what is now northwestern Pakistan and eastern Afghanistan. The region came under the political influence of a variety of kingdoms which resulted in the emergence of a mixed school of art. The sculptural tradition in Gandhara had the confluence of Bactria, Parthia and the local Gandhara tradition. However, the real patrons of this school of art were the Scythians and the Kushanas, particularly Kanishka.\n\n**Features of Gandhara art borrowed from Greco-Bactria:**\n\n* The Gandhara school drew upon the anthropomorphic traditions of Roman religion and represented the Buddha with a **youthful Apollo-like face**, dressed in garments resembling those seen on Roman imperial statues. Its significance lies in the fact that until then **Buddha** was not **represented in a human-like figure**.\n* **Wavy hair in a top knot,** sometimes a moustache on the face, **urna** (a dot or third eye) between the eyebrows, **elongated earlobes**, garment with thick pleats usually covering both shoulders, and muscular formation of the body are other resembling features.\n* Other motifs and techniques that Gandhara school incorporated from classical Roman art, include vine scrolls, cherubs bearing garlands, tritons, and centaurs.\n* The images having physiognomic features depicting **symbolic expression** such as of calmness, sharp outlines, smooth surface, **expressive images** etc. are the centre point of attraction.\n\nGandhara art not only assimilated the features of Hellenistic art but also borrowed many West Asiatic and **Central Asiatic features** such as:\n\n* Disc-shaped attribute behind the head of Buddha was associated with solar deities of ancient Persian and Greek art.\n* Figures with conical and pointed caps on their heads resemble the Scythian caps of similar design.\n* The regular depiction of fire worship in the Gandhara art, a trait which was probably derived from Iranian sources.\n\nThe foreign elements imbibed in the Gandhara art not only placed it on a high pedestal of artistic achievements but also made possible the naturalistic depiction of the human form for the first time in the Indian art history.",

      "explanation": "In 2016, the United States designated India as \u2018major defence partner\u2019, a status unique to India. However, recently, the US foreign and economic policies have started to appear against India\u2019s self-esteem and ambitions. There are several issues that introduce friction into what US considers its global strategy and what India envisages as its self-esteem and ambitions.\n\n* **West Asia:** The US\u2019 West Asia policy is aligned in line with that of Israel and Saudi Arabia which stands adversarial to that of Iran. But for India, a strong, united and peaceful Iran holds significance not only for its oil imports but also for the Chabahar port and International North-South Transport Corridor (INTC) that will enable India to have a reach to Central Asia and counter China\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). However, this stands opposed to the US policy of restricting Iran\u2019s influence in the region. The US has pulled out of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) nuclear agreement and subsequently imposed sanctions under Countering America\u2019s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA) on Iran.\n* **Afghanistan:** Political development in Kabul have always had its implications in New Delhi. Situation in Afghanistan also poses security risks for India given Pakistan\u2019s close proximity to the Taliban. This is more so given India\u2019s huge investments in Afghanistan to bring peace and stability there. But the US policy has moved to focus on its withdrawal of troops. Any peace deal with the Taliban, an insurgent body, will legitimise the terrorist activities and hurt India\u2019s interests.\n* **Russia:** India\u2019s strategic relations with Russia have historically been very significant and useful given Russia\u2019s veto power at the Security Council. Russia is also the major defence partner of India. It is also emerging as a major option to meet India\u2019s energy requirements. But, as bequeathed by the Cold War, the US considers Russia as its adversary and it has brought Russia under the CAATSA. This stood opposed to India\u2019s defence deals with Russia involving the S-400 missile systems.\n* **Trade relations:** Being a developing country, India wants to bring millions of its masses out of poverty and to have a strong economic footprint globally. The US is a major trade partner in this context and it Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) has been a useful mechanism for India. But the US\u2019 policy to bring back jobs home and to restrict China\u2019s growth trajectory has negative fallout on India. The US has accused India of not opening the Indian economy for American trade by means of tariffs, intellectual property regulations, subsidies, etc. and has clamped tariffs on Indian exports to America.\n\nMoreover, the USA\u2019s National Defense Strategy 2018 marked Russia and China as its central challenge and for the US India is an ideal balancer against rising China. In this context, India must convince the US that a strong India is in concurrence with the US\u2019 interest. Besides, India must follow **strategic hedging** i.e. simultaneous engagements with major powers because in international relations, there are no permanent friends or permanent enemies, only permanent interests.",

However, Quad\u2019s shared objective to support a \u201cfree, open and prosperous\u201d Indo-Pacific region, is also forming the basis of a trade agreement and turn it into a major trade bloc.\n\n**Is Quad Transforming into a Trade Bloc?**\n\n* **India-Pacific Ocean Initiative (IPOI):** The IPOI is an open, non-treaty-based global initiative that aims at practical cooperation in seven thematic areas which also include Maritime Resources; Capacity Building and Resource Sharing; Science, and Trade Connectivity and Maritime Transport. Australia and Japan have agreed to lead IPOI pillars on Maritime Ecology and Connectivity respectively.\n* **Free and Open Indo Pacific (FOIP):** Japan\u2019s FOIP builds around \u2018two continents\u2019, Asia and Africa, and \u2018two oceans\u2019, Pacific and Indian. Japanese FOIP endorses cooperation with countries who share the common vision of a free and open Indo-Pacific.\n* **Blue Dot Network:**It is a multi-stakeholder initiative led by the USA along with Japan and Australia to bring together governments, the private sector, and civil society to promote high-quality, trusted standards for global infrastructure development. It could directly counter China\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).\n* **Supply Chain Resilience Initiative (SCRI):** As COVID-19 and trade tensions between China and the United Statesthreatened globalsupply chains, Japan mooted the Supply Chain Resilience Initiative (SCRI) as a trilateral approach to trade,with India and Australia asthe key-partners. SCRI is a directresponse to individual companies and economies concerned about Chinese political behaviour and the disruption that could lead to the supply chain.\n\n**Challenges Remain**\n\n* **Integration:** All the trade associated initiative launched by the QUAD nations are independent. There is a need for a joint push in the domain of trade and economy.\n* **Lack of Cooperation:** The Quad nations have so far not been able to iron out their trade-related difference. For example, India still does not have a Free Trade Agreement with Australia and the USA.\n* **Need for Clear Vision:** The Quad nations need to better explain the Indo-Pacific Vision in an overarching framework with the objective of advancing everyone\u2019s economic and security interests.\n  + This will reassure the littoral Statesthat the Quad will be a factor for the regional benefit, and a far cry from Chinese allegations that it is some sort of a military alliance.\n\nQuad member countries agreed that a free, open, prosperous, and inclusive Indo-Pacific region will serve the long-term interests of all countries in the region and of the world at large. However, there is a need to put the military component and the economic component together.",

      "explanation": "India\u2019srelationship with the US on defence and strategic issues hasstrengthened asreflected in IndoUS proximity in the security architecture of the Indo-Pacific region. In 2014, the US emerged as the top arms supplier to India, pushing Russia to the second position.\n\n**Russia: A Traditional Partner**\n\n* Russia has been a longstanding and time-tested partner. India has longstanding and wide-ranging cooperation with Russia in the field of defence.\n* Military-technical cooperation has evolved to involve the development and production of advanced defence technologies and systems, such as BrahMos.\n* However, India desires to diversify its defence imports. There is also dissatisfaction in India with post-sales services and maintenance offered by Russia.\n\nThe 21st century has seen the rise of a relentless China. China\u2019s assertive, and bullying attitude is most evident in the Indo-Pacific region where it is challenging the sovereignty of ASEAN countries thus also threatening free sea.\n\nAn engaging feature of the current global situation is the transformation of the Sino-Russian relationship from enmity to entente. The changed scenario has an impact on India and the USA.\n\n**USA: India\u2019s New Best Friend?**\n\n* India has steadily developed important military ties with the US as their interests in the Indo-Pacific are being threatened by China\u2019s expansionist policies.\n* The US supports India\u2019s desired role as a \u201cnet security provider\u201d to preserve maritime transportation routes in the Indo-Pacific region.\n* Thus, India and theUS have signed a number of defence dealswhich also includesfourfoundational agreements viz., LEMOA, COMCASA, BECA, and GSOMIA. They enable interoperability of assets, provide each other logistic support, and allow sale of sensitive weapons.\n* The US has also sold weapons like Apache, P-8I aircraft which have enhanced India\u2019s defence capabilities.\n* QUAD which is an informal strategic forum between US, India, Japan, and Australia has a shared objective to support a \u201cfree, open and prosperous\u201d Indo-Pacific region.\u201d\n* However, the US support doesn\u2019t come without a rider. It has also frowned on the S-400 deal which India has signed with Russia and has also threatened to impose sanctions on India under CAATSA.\n\nIn the last two decades, the US and India defence relations have strengthened due to sustained efforts from both the countries to iron out differences and agree on protocols in working together against common threats. But, India needs to balance relations with its two defence partners by considering its concerns associated with China and Pakistan over security issues.",

      "explanation": "The Fourteenth Finance Commission was constituted by the President under Article 280 of the Constitution in 2013 to make recommendations for the period 2015-20. Dr. Y. V. Reddy was appointed the Chairman of the Commission. Finance Commission is a constitutional body created to address issues of vertical and horizontal imbalances of federal finances in India.\n\n**The 14th Finance Commission enabled the States to improve their fiscal position in the following ways:**\n\n* **Share in Centre\u2019s Divisible Pool:** The commission recommended an increase in the share of States in the Center\u2019s divisible tax pool to 42% from 32% at present. This will enhance the states autonomy in deciding their expenditure priorities.\n* **Centrally Sponsored Schemes:** The Commission also recommended eight centrally sponsored schemes (CSS) to be delinked from support from the Centre. Thus, States will be sharing a higher fiscal responsibility and autonomy to implement development initiatives.\n* **Taxation:** The Commission has recommended that tax devolution should be the primary source of transfer of funds to States. This would increase the flow of unconditional transfers and give States more flexibility in their spending.\n* **Grants:** Transfers were proposed including grants to rural and urban local bodies, a performance grant along with grants for disaster relief and revenue deficit. These transfers total to approximately 5.3 lakh crore for the period 2015-20.\n* **Compensation:** The commission recommended compensating States fully for three years in case of revenue loss after GST implementation. The Commission suggested that 100% compensation be paid to the States in the first, second and third years, 75% compensation in the fourth year and 50% compensation in the fifth and final year. It also recommended the creation of an autonomous and independent GST compensation fund through legislative actions\n\nThe Finance Commission recommendations will reform the State finances which will assume greater significance for macroeconomic management as the fiscal deficit of State governments reached unsustainable levels. After the recommendations, States will get autonomy in deciding their expenditure priority, which will enhance the spirit of \u201cbalancing wheel of fiscal federalism\u201d.",

      "explanation": "Both the United States and India are the largest democratic countries in the world, based on federalism, in their political structure. Democracy can only thrive and flourish where the individuals in society are treated equally and without discrimination. Thus, it was necessary to incorporate provisions in the Constitution to remove the hurdle of existing social and economic inequalities and enable the diverse communities to enjoy the rights and liberties guaranteed under the Constitution.\n\nThe right to equality means the absence of legal discrimination on grounds of caste, race, religion, sex, and place of birth and ensures equal rights to all citizens.\n\n* **Right to Equality in India:** In India, Chapter III named as \u201cFundamental Rights\u201d was added in the Constitution by the Constituent Assembly. The Constitution follows both the British model of \u2018Equality before Law\u2019 and American model of \u2018equal protection of law\u2019 (Article 14). It also provides for both civil-legal as well as socio-economic equality. It also highlights substantive equality. The Constitution also provides for affirmative action to ensure equality (Article 16). It focuses on ensuring equality of outcomes along with equality of opportunity. The right also prevents discrimination and abolishes untouchability (Article 17).\n* **Right to Equality in the US:** The original Constitution did not prevent discrimination. The US derived Right to Equality from Declaration of Rights and the Bill of Rights. It was inserted in the Bill of Rights through fourteenth Amendment in year 1868. The US follows the concept of \u2018equal protection of law\u2019 which highlights the equal treatment under equal circumstances. The right majorly emphasises on civil and legal equality.\n\nThe Right to Equality is considered a basic feature of both the Constitutions and plays a key role in achieving social and economic justice in our society where upliftment of certain classes is considered necessary for our country to flourish. The emphasis is on the fundamental unity of individuals by providing equal opportunities and treatment to all.",

      "explanation": "The S-400 Triumf is a mobile, surface-to-air missile system (SAM) designed by Russia. It is the most dangerous operationally deployed modern long-range SAM (MLR SAM) in the world, considered much ahead of the US-developed Terminal High Altitude Area Defence system (THAAD). India is engaged with Russia for the purchase of five S-400 Missile Systems.\n\n**Why S 400 is different from others:**\n\n* S-400 Triumf is considered one of the world\u2019s most advanced air defence systems that can simultaneously track and neutralize a range of incoming objects spanning aircraft, missiles and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV).\n* Each system has four different types of missiles for up to 40 km, 120 km, 250 km and maximum range of 400 km and up to 30 km altitude. The different ranges and varying altitudes create a layered air defence net.\n* Unlike S-400, the American THAAD is a one-dimensional missile system as it can fire only one type of missile upto a range of 150-200 km and Patriot has a range of 180 km.\n* THAAD cannot intercept a fighter jet while S-400 can.\n* The deployment time for S-400 and Patriot is 5 minutes and 25 minutes respectively.\n* The maximum target speed of S-400 is 4.8km/sec as compared to 1.38km/sec of Patriot.\n\nEven though buying S-400 from Russia attracted criticism from the US under the CAATSA agreement, the purchase of the much-awaited S-400 for India was inevitable keeping its volatile neighbors in mind.",

The initiative is aimed at accelerating the development and deployment of interconnected electricity grids across continents, countries, and communities, and improving energy access of the poorest through mini-grids and off-grid solutions. The idea for the single global solar grid was first outlined at the International Solar Alliance in 2018, by the Prime Minister of India.\n\n**The Green Grid Initiative aims:**\n\n* To speed up the process of decarbonising energy production.\n* To create an international network of global interconnected solar power grid to ensure 24\u00d77 supply of green power.\n* To help in increasing investment in R&D centers by pooling skill, technology and financial resources.\n\n**As good as it sounds, the implementation of the Green Grid has to counter the following challenges:**\n\n* The creation of global transmission infrastructure involves huge financing.\n* For connecting with the Green Grid, a global cooperation between the countries is needed.\n* As the grid will pass through several geographical locations, it will be sensitive to the security risks emanating from terror organisations.\n\nThe Green Grid initiative is a transformational new programme, with the goal of making universal access to renewable energy a reality. It will ensure that clean power is the most affordable and reliable option for all countries to meet their energy needs efficiently by 2030.",

      "explanation": "India\u2019s climate change policy has undergone a significant change over the years, from seeking energy security to taking initiative in the field of clean energy at a global level, the country\u2019s diplomatic stand at the Conference of Parties reflects its pro-environment outlook. By accepting the net-zero commitments, India has reiterated its stand that its policy on climate change is based on the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities.\n\nIndia, since ancient times, has always promoted harmony with nature. This can be further evidenced by the country\u2019s commitment to the Paris Accord and the acceptance of the net-zero targets, proving that India is aware of clean energy\u2019s significance.\n\nIn this context, the five-point agenda of Panchamrit for dealing with climate change, including ambitious targets related to the use of renewable energy for meeting the country\u2019s energy requirements, reduction in carbon emissions and intensity in its economy and achieving the target of net-zero, are a clear statement by India of its commitment towards clean energy as well as its intent for taking a leading role in the same.\n\n* India\u2019s geopolitical and global outlook, based on the constantly evolving global environmental challenges, can be witnessed by the country\u2019s diplomacy at the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).\n* India does not agree to the imposition of legally binding targets since it requires strategic autonomy to (a) pursue its domestic developmental agenda and (b) identify the method required to commit to targets related to climate change and clean energy.\n* India, keeping the ambition of enhancing its global profile and power ambitions, has moved away from a reactionary to a participatory approach. This can be seen with India\u2019s change in position from its response to the Kyoto Protocol commitments as compared to the Paris Agreement.\n* Further, keeping in line with its diplomatic endeavours globally and the recognition of clean energy\u2019s significance, India has taken a leading role along with other major global players in several international initiatives such as the International Solar Alliance (ISA), the One Sun, One World and One Grid programme and the Lifestyle for Environment (LiFE) Movement.\n* Further, India has also raised its concerns regarding the reluctance of the developed nations in sharing the necessary technologies with the developing nations to enable them to effectively deal with climate change.\n\nThus, India has modified its climate change policy according to the developments taking place on a global scale and has taken initiatives in mitigating issues arising out of climate change while keeping in mind its geopolitical objectives.",

      "explanation": "**(a):**In the history of humankind, war is one of the catastrophic instruments created by mankind itself. All around impact of war is not just limited to this generation but its hazardous impacts extend to next generations.\n\nWe are witnessing that how Russia \u2013 Ukraine war seriously impacting the all-possible corners of society by the way of gross human rights violation, disruptions in global demand supply chain, wastage of precious resources, widespread painful migration.\n\nTo avoid this type of episodes, nations should take collective stands and action keeping in view their own collective global interest rather than independent stands and individual national interest.\n\n**Possible ethical issues while launching the war and its continuation**\n\n* **Ethical Issues of Human rights-** In war time there is gross violation of human right. Women, children and other vulnerable section faces unprecedented hardships. For example, Human genocide, heinous massacre and brutality against women and children comes under the worsen form of human right violation.\n* **Ethical dimensions of rights of future generation and present generation-**Cost of present generation war is paid by next generation. For ex- Hiroshima -Nagasaki bombing in second world war. The ethical concern here is why the cost of present generation should be paid by coming future generation?\n* **Issues of accountability and answerability-** In war time, who is accountable and answerable to whom, there is no fix criteria.\n* **National interest vs Global interest \u2013**There is grave ethical concern is that nations put their own individual national interest over collective global interest.\n* **Individual Aspiration vs Collective Aspiration-**Individual aspirations of political peers override the collective aspirations of millions of masses.\n* **Means vs Ends**\u2013 For gaining territorial and expansion ends nation use wrong means of war, border conflict etc. It led to dangerous consequences which impacts all corners of society and even next generations.\n* **Issues of proportionate vs disproportionate dimension of war**- Ethics of war should be entitled to its proportionate response but the activity of nuclear attack, mass massacre and gross violation of war ethics changes war into disproportionate dimensions. For example, attack on Ukraine nuclear reactor by Russia can amount to grave consequences to the world.\n\nAbout war, Nobel Laureat John Steinbeck famously quoted that \u201call war is symptom of man's failure as a thinking animal. Humankind should understand the fact that war can never fix the problem. Aim of prosperous and peaceful society can be achieve through dialogue, diplomacy, decency.\n\n**(b):**\n\n**(i) Constitutional Morality-**In an important case, **NCT of Delhi vs Union of India,** Hon'ble justice of supreme court **Shri Deepak Mishra** wrote that \u201cconstitutional morality in its strictest sense implies a strict and complete adherence to constitutional principles as enshrined in the various segments of the document. It is required that all constitutional functionaries to **\u2018cultivate and develop a spirit of constitutionalism\u2019.** where every action taken by them is governed by and is in strict conformity with the basic tenets of the constitution\u201d. For example, judgement of supreme court on Sabarimala and Hadiya case, abolition of sec377 etc.\n\n**(ii) Conflict of Interest-** This situation arise when public duty interest conflicts with personal interest. This is the case where conscience being caught up in between the personal and professional ends. For example, former ICICI chairman Chanda Kochhar\u2019s resignation, former NSE CEO Chitra Ramkrishna case.\n\n**(iii) Probity in public life -** Probity is one of the virtues in public life. Person with higher **probity quotient** has higher grade of inegrity,honesty, decency and morality. Impartiality and non-partisanship are key instruments of aptitude of probity in public life. For example, life example of Abdul kalam and former PM Lal Bahadur Shastri.\n\n**(iv)Challenges of digitalization-**Digitalization is the process of transformation of possible information into digital data format.\u00a0 Challenges-\n\n* Digital illiteracy and issue of digital divide among people.\n* Cyber frauds and digital economic fraud.\n* Cyber warfare.\n* Mass surveillance and digital phishing attacks.\n* Issues of poor network and connectivity.\n* High energy consuming devices.\n\n**(V) Devotion to duty-** It express the strong emotion, integrity, loyalty, determination and admiration towards duty. Swami Vivekananda famously quoted that **\"Devotion to duty is the highest form of worship of God\u201d.** For example, Nishkama karma concept of Bhagwat Geeta, way of life of Mother Teresa.",

      "explanation": "Ever since its birth in 1947, India has been a witness to various kinds of terrorist and insurgent activities. Over the years India has learned from its mistake and evolved numerous ways to tackle terror funding and other related activities.\n\n**Major sources of terror funding**\n\n* **State Sponsorship:** The use of terror to further diplomatic interests is a known practice. States sponsor crimes and support terrorist to be able to use them when needed for their purpose.\n* **Counterfeit Currency:** It involves directly printing and circulating fake currency in the market. Alternatively, this is a tool used by neighbouring states to destabilize the Indian economy.\n* **Organised Crime:** Criminal organizations generally work in nexus and are often connected to bigger terrorist groups. The flow of resources is two-ways between these two.\n* **Extortion:** This remains the biggest source of funding of terrorism in India especially in the North-East.\n* **Hawala System:** This is an illegal method of transferring money, generally through international borders that is used by criminal networks.\n\n**Efforts to curtail sources**\n\n* **National Investigation Agency (NIA):** It is the premier agency in India for combating terror across states without special permission from the states.\n* **Unlawful Activities Prevention Act:** This anti-terror legislation seeks to designate an individual as a \u201cterrorist\u201d.\n* **National Intelligence Grid (NATGRID):** It is a centralised data library of terror and crime related information.\n* **SAMADHAN Doctrine:** Developed specifically for the Left-Wing Extremism problems, it also aims to curb the access of terror organizations to funds.\n\nRecently, the third No Money for Terror (NMFT) Ministerial Conference on Counter-Terrorism Financing was held in New Delhi, India. It sought to:\n\n* Collaborate with countries around the world to curtail terror and extremist funding.\n* To set up a secretariat regarding the same in the country, which won't be an investigative body but operate on the concept of collaboration and cooperation.\n* To investigate new and emerging threats and methods of propagating terrorism.\n\nBeing surrounded by two hostile neighbours does not allow India any leeway for complacent behaviour on the question of internal security. Through several measures, India continues to fight the battle against terrorism.",
