      "explanation": "The Indian party system, over more than six decades after Independence, provides a contrasting picture of partial success, serious shortcomings and huge challenges. The contradictions and paradoxes in the present phase of transition can be described as follows:\n\n* **Personality Cult in Politics \u2014** Votes are sought in the name of the leader of a party rather than ideology of the party or pertinent issues. Eg. The last general elections of 2014 swept by the \u2018Modi Wave\u2019.\n* Increasing influence of **dynastic politics** in the absence of inner party democracy\u2014This unlike other countries, say the US, where party members vote for candidates to run for presidency.\n* **Sharp erosion in the ideological orientation** of political parties - Party dynamics in India has resulted in emergence of valueless politics\u2014with caste, religion, money and muscle power playing huge roles.\n* End of single-party dominance and **increase in influence of regional parties \u2013** This resulted in nationalization of regional issues. Also, unprincipled alliances were formed between political parties that do not have common ideology, resulting in \u2018politics of convenience\u2019 to form coalition governments. Example- Current BJP-PDP alliance in J&K.\n* **Multi-Party System \u2014** In contrast to other countries where there are two major parties, there are 7 recognised national parties in India, in addition to dozens of regional parties.\n\nThe party system can be said to be moving from social cohesion to fragmentation and from a stable pattern to fluidity.",

      "explanation": "In the 31 years since the organization\u2019s founding in 1985, SAARC\u2019s efficacy in the region has been limited by tensions and disagreements between India and Pakistan. SAARC has largely been defunct for the last few years because of India-Pakistan friction and could soon become non-functional.\n\nThis was highlighted in the aftermath of an attack by militants that crossed the Line of Control into India-administered Kashmir to strike at an Indian Army camp in Uri. Since the attack, the Indian government has strongly condemned Pakistan and looked to isolate Islamabad on the world stage. This was followed by India pulling out of the 19th SAARC Summit in Islamabad in November 2016. Afghanistan, Bhutan and Bangladesh also followed suit.\n\nBy pulling out of the SAARC summit in Islamabad, India tried to achieve two ends: sending a tough message in the wake of the Uri attack but also that it is going ahead with its plan for \u2018SAARC minus Pakistan\u2019 instead. Some believe that SAARC minus one can better address South Asian challenges because the civil-military dissonance on Pakistan's policy towards India is making it difficult for Pakistan to relate to other states of the South Asian region. Also, Pakistan has been singularly stalling the process of economic integration through its policy of disallowing connectivity through its territory. Two most recent examples have been the talks on trade liberalisation and cross-border trade in energy during the last years where Islamabad pulled back just when the agreements were ready for signature. Pakistan also walked away from agreements on road connectivity which resulted in a \u2018sub-regional cooperation\u2019 called BBIN framework between Bangladesh, Bhutan, India and Nepal. Further, India is looking at the BIMSTEC (the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation) as an alternative to SAARC as was witnessed with the BIMSTEC summit on the sidelines of the BRICS Summit.\n\nAll of the above limit the ability of SAARC to prosper as a regional organization. However, without effectively engaging Pakistan, the multiple challenges faced by SAARC countries on the economic and security fronts cannot be met satisfactorily. Much of the security challenges emanate from Pakistan because it uses terrorism as an instrument of its state policy. It stands between South Asia and Central Asia and holds the key to intra as well as inter-regional trade and commerce. Therefore, it is difficult to address the aforesaid challenges without roping in Pakistan into the SAARC framework for regional cooperation.",

This may not be the first time India has undertaken quick cross-LoC operations, but it has never before chosen to share information so publicly.\n\nStrategic impact of this action can be following.\n\n* This surgical strike indicates that India\u2019s technical capabilities **(Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance \u2014 C4ISR)** have improved a great deal.\n* The terms \u201csurgical strike\u201d and \u201cpre-emptive strike\u201d used by India were intended to make it clear to the enemy that there will be repercussions and crossing the border does not guarantee immunity\n* The strikes proved to be an important element for maintaining the morale of the people of India and the armed forces.\n* The strike reinforced the credibility of the government and displayed its resolve, even as justified restraint and maturity was on display. This act would also counter India\u2019s image of being a soft state.\n* Russia has also backed India, saying Pakistan should take effective steps in order to stop activities of terrorist groups in its territory. India seems to have played its cards well by seeking international and regional isolation of Pakistan before striking infiltrator targets across the LOC.\n\nThere are also several negative impacts of these types of acts as it may escalate the conflict especially in case of Pakistan, Security forces can be trapped in enemy territory. It could be a cause of international censure for violating other country\u2019s border.",

Ex: China, Pakistan\n* Bitter relations with some of the neighbouring countries. Ex: Pakistan\n* Porous nature of border with some countries that provides safe route to human traffickers, illegal arms dealers, drug smugglers etc. Ex: Myanmar\n\nOwing to such peculiarities, having infrastructure and technology does not alone suffice for effective border management. Following strategies can be adopted for effective border management.\n\n* Co-ordination among various agencies such as customs, immigration, armed forces, border security and intelligence agencies is required that will strengthen the border guarding and management.\n* Smart border management to identify and implement controls which aim to improve border security by enabling effective communication and coordination.\n* Use of Drone, Night vision cameras, sensors to check the illegal migration, terrorist movement can help in effective border management.\n* Border fencing along the border such as with Bangladesh, Myanmar, Nepal can help in better border management.\n* Coordination among neighbouring countries would also strengthen the measures taken for border management.",

Cyber warfare is gaining importance due to increasing density of internet.

Muzaffarnagar riots in Uttar Pradesh got intensified because of misuse of social media by non-state actors.\n\nIn these circumstances effective strategies should be adopted to curb the threat posed by internet and social media. Following are some of the guidelines that can be very useful.\n\n* India recently appointed first Chief Information Security Officer (CISO). It will help India in developing the vision and policy to fight cyber crime and manage cyber security more effectively.\n* Creation of National Cyber Security Agency (NCSA) would improve India\u2019s resilience and defense system.\n* Monitoring of content on internet by intelligence agencies such as Intelligence Bureau, RAW can prevent any attempt to radicalize youths.\n* National Cyber Security Policy 2013 aims at protection of information infrastructure in cyber space, reduce vulnerabilities. A National and sectoral 24\u00d77 mechanism has been envisaged to deal with cyber threats through National Critical Information Infrastructure Protection Centre (NCIIPC)\n* Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-In) has been designated to act as Nodal agency for coordination of crisis management efforts.",

(Ex \u2013 NSCN-Khaplang group)\n* Hilly terrain, dense forest and porous borders give strategic advantages for the insurgent Guerilla groups and at the same time it creates big hurdle for the counter insurgency operations.\n* Racial clashes are very common here due to diverse racial profile of the region. In a fractured society the insurgent groups penetrate easily.\n* Active and covert foreign support to these insurgent groups, through training, logistic and moral support has also been a big hurdle to eradicate these groups.\n\nThe twin approach of development and counter insurgency operations coupled with honest political dialogue process may provide the best answer to the long infested insurgency in the North-East.",

      "explanation": "Local self-governance means a system of governance where the local people or village people take decisions for their own governance and development through their representatives or direct participation. Realising the importance that the all-round development of the country is possible only through the development of rural India, Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs) were constitutionalized under the 73rd Amendment Act of the Constitution of India in 1992.\n\nPlan documents of both the central and state governments and various committees have emphasized the importance of these bodies in the polity. Five-year plans have also laid special emphasis on the role of Panchayats in rural developments.\n\nRural Development includes measures to strengthen the democratic structure of society through the PRIs. PRIs have been used to improve the rural infrastructure, income of rural households and delivery systems pertaining to education, health and safety mechanisms. These institutions are to be galvanized to become effective instruments of social and economic change at the local level.\n\n**Sources of Money**\n\nApart from the tax sharing and grants-in-aid from the state and the centre, the PRIs enjoy powers to levy various kinds of taxes and duties in rural areas.\n\nMajor tax powers include land tax; house building tax; vehicle tax; water, drainage and sanitation taxes; tax on profession, trade; tax on fairs and other entertainments; octroi on animals or goods or both brought for sale; tax for construction and public works; street cleaning fee; and pilgrimage fee. Fees for the use of panchayat shelter; user charges for hospitals and schools; fee for use of common resources like grazing land etc.; fee on markets and weekly bazaars are also the source of income. New powers recommended by SFCs (State Finance Commissions) include house tax; tax on pumps and tractors; tax on highway services; tax on village produce sold in regulated markets; tax on telephones and cable T.V.\n\nHowever, the decisions as to which taxes, duties, tolls and fees should be assigned to local governments and which should be shared by the State with them, continue to be with the state legislatures. Therefore, more devolution of financial powers to the PRIs is the need of the hour to make them as viable institutions to effect change in the socio-economic development of the rural India.",

      "explanation": "Geographically, India is placed between the two largest opium growing areas in the world. To the west is the Golden Crescent (Afghanistan) and to the east is the Golden Triangle (Myanmar). This makes India vulnerable to drug trafficking through its borders and other illicit activities, and has enhanced her internal security concerns.\n\nThere exist linkages between drug trafficking and other illicit activities such as gunrunning, money laundering and human trafficking, which are as follows:\n\n* An increasing interoperability has been witnessed between drug cartels and other criminal groups. In Afghanistan around 85% of the opium growing area falls under Taliban. Taliban uses the funds from drug trade in many different ways like weapons smuggling, human trafficking, and proliferation of terrorism etc.\n* Drug trafficking groups also get attracted to human trafficking activities as there is some overlap between the routes used and there are advantages to be gained by sharing established logistical infrastructure, which includes transportation and storage facilities.\n* Similarly, gunrunning and money laundering require logistics supports which are shared by these organizations. At times these activities seem to sustain each other such as smuggling drugs by hiding it in human body parts. The revenue generated from drug trade is laundered to create assets such as casinos, bars, hotels etc. which again became breeding grounds for other crimes. Nexus between drug lords and armed groups gives rise to thriving weapons business.\n\n**Following counter-measures can be opted against these crimes:**\n\n* As these crimes are trans-national in character, countering them requires cooperation among all countries.\n* Making the border management more robust and plugging the gaps by bringing in force the recommendations of Madhukar Gupta Committee on border protection. The committee has given broad recommendations on the issues of Threats and Border Protection, assessment of force level, deployment on the border, infrastructure and technology issues for protection of border and administrative issues\n* Making the police and the concerned authorities acquainted to dark web and other modes of operation.\n* Sensitizing the public against negative fallouts of drugs and starting rehabilitation programmes.\n\nThis drug problem is a serious menace giving impetus to various other crimes, so strong political will and hard measures if required should be opted to tackle this challenge. Technical solutions are also necessary to augment and complement the traditional methods of border guarding. Working on both the front can probably address the existing problems of internal security.",

Overground workers(OGWs) provide a support system to terrorist groups and networks in carrying out their activities in insurgency affected areas.\n\n### The role played by OGWs\n\n* **Food and Logistics support:** OGWs assist terror networks to meet their basic needs.\n* **Propaganda and radical narrative:** This provide the ideological background to the terror outfits.\n* **Finding new recruits:** Pool of Disgruntled youth provide a fertile ground for OGWs to propagate radicalisation and hire new recruits.\n* **Coordination with other stakeholders:** OGWs coordinate with secessionist leaders, and Organised crime Networks to meet their political objectives.\n* **Conduit for Illegal Money:** This is done through illegal trade, counterfeit currency, Tax evasion and Hawala transactions. These funds are also used to instigate anti-state protest like stone-pelting.\n* **Assist in the planning and execution of terror plans:** They provide operational planning, intelligence information, safety routes, maps and other inputs that are needed for terror operations.\n\n### Measures to neutralize the influence of OGWs\n\n* **Address the root cause of alienation among affected communities:** This is done by addressing genuine concerns and through awareness campaigns that dispel false propaganda.\n* **Rehabilitating orphans and women:** This would fulfil the state\u2019s duty to ensure Social welfare. Also, It would counter the influence of OGWs to find new recruits.\n* **Intelligence Infrastructure:** To keep track of radicalisation attempts by OGWs and recruitment agents in order to stop this process at its inception.\n* **Human and Electronic Surveillance:** This is used to tap into existing networks to pre-empt terror attempts.\n* **International cooperation:** To facilitates follow up on suspects and terror networks.\n* **Fast track courts:** Laws like Public Safety acts for the speedy conviction of terrorists and OGWs through fast track special courts.\n\nHowever, Misuse of the legal provision in the random booking of youth on mere suspicion should be avoided. The best defence against terrorism is to ensure that the people do not have the incentive to pick up arms against the country by providing them equitable political, social and economic opportunities.",

      "explanation": "India and Myanmar share a long 1,643 km geographical land border and maritime boundary in the Bay\u00a0of Bengal, which act as India\u2019s gateway to South-East Asia.\n\nIndia-Myanmar border is highly porous, poorly guarded and located along a remote, underdeveloped, insurgency-prone region and proximate to opium producing area.\n\n### Various challenges across the India-Myanmar border\n\n* **Cross-Border Terrorism:** Indo-Myanmar border area have become a safe haven for dozens of insurgent groups. These insurgent groups performs offensive action in India and brings instability to the area by promoting separatist tendencies and take an easy hide in Myanmar.\n  + These groups also take advantage of loopholes in free movement regime across border to supply arms and drugs in India.\n* **Connectivity:** Several connectivity projects like Kaladan Multi-Modal project and IMT Trilateral Highway project are underway, but the ground level progress is quite unfortunate.\n* **Free Movement Regime:** It permits tribals to travel 16 km across the borders without any visa restrictions and allowed them to carry heavy loads. This loophole is well utilized by insurgents for trafficking of arms and drugs and to find safe havens in Myanmar.\n* **Boundary Agreement 1967:** Though the agreement has delineated the borders between the two countries but not much has been crystallised on ground level.\n* **Tribal Linkages:** The Indo-Myanmar border is densely populated with tribals, and these tribal communities have strong social-cultural linkages across borders and they refuse to accept the artificial border lines.\n* **Security Forces:** Assam Rifles had a responsibility of guarding the Indo-Myanmar border, but most of it battalions are engaged in counter-insurgency operations. Therefore, it functions like counter-insurgency force rather than border-guarding force.\n* **Infrastructural Facility at Border Check-Points:** The infrastructure facilities at border check-points is not sufficient to meet the required challenge. **Moreh-Zokhawater** point has been declared as **Integrated Check-Point (ICP)** but nothing much have materialised on the ground.\n* **Difficult Terrain Across Border:** The geographical terrain around border areas is highly inaccessible, so it becomes quite difficult to develop communication and connectivity.\n* **Trafficking:** Proximity to **\u2018golden triangle\u2019** has made Indo-Myanmar border highly vulnerable to drug trafficking and the border has become a gateway for trafficking of women and small children to South Asian Nations.\n* **Rohingya Issue:** Influx of marginalised muslim minority rohingya community has raised a serious **sociocultural confrontations** in the areas due to increased burden on local resources.\n\n### Steps to Counter the Challenges\n\nThe vulnerability of the India-Myanmar border is posing a serious challenge to the internal security of the country. The Government of India should pay immediate attention to effectively manage this border.\n\n* It should strengthen the security of the border by either giving the Assam Rifles the single mandate of guarding the border or deploying another border guarding force such as the Border Security Force (BSF).\n* It should initiate a revision of the FMR and reduce the permitted distance of unrestricted travel.\n* The construction of the ICP along with other infrastructure should be expedited.\n* **The Comprehensive Integrated Border Management System (CIBMS)** which is touted as a robust and integrated system, is capable of addressing the gaps in the present system of border security by seamlessly integrating human resources, weapons, and high-tech surveillance equipment, should be proactively deployed.\n* Sustained community interaction programmes so that the border tribal communities can be sensitised to participate in the nation building on both sides of the border.\n\nIndia should endeavour to meaningfully engage with Myanmar and solicit its cooperation in resolving all outstanding issues and better manage their mutual border.",

      "explanation": "The Fourth Industrial Revolution is a way of describing the blurring of boundaries between the physical, digital, and biological worlds. It\u2019s a fusion of advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI), robotics, the Internet of Things (IoT), quantum computing, and other technologies. It is about more than just technology-driven change; it is an opportunity to help everyone, including government, policy-makers and people to harness converging technologies in order to create an inclusive, human-centred future.\n\nThe recent technological changes have fundamentally altered the way states govern and people respond. The growth of computers, digital technologies and telecommunications has drastically changed the way the state conducts its functions.\n\nElectronic governance or e-governance is one of them. E-governance is about a process of reform in the way governments work, share information and deliver services. Specifically, e-government harnesses information and communication technologies (ICT) to deliver information and services to citizens and businesses.\n\nSome positive examples of the e-governance that have promoted effectiveness of government at the national level include:\n\n* **Digital India:** Itstrivesto bring inclusive growth and bridge the digital divide by leveraging technology solutions that are low cost, developmental, transformative and designed to empower ordinary Indians.\n* **BharatNet:** One of the largest digital infrastructures of the world was conceived to connect all the 250,000 gram panchayats by a high-speed optical fibre network.\n* India isseeing a dramatic growth in the number of online transactionsinvolving citizens and the government. It proves that citizens are quick to adopt these technologies. The onus lies on the government to provide the relevant infrastructure and policies to enable effective digitization of the economy.\n* **Umang:** It is a platform that enables access to services offered by the Government, such as EPF, Ayushman Bharat, on mobile phone.\n* **Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT):** Under this inititative subsidies and scholarsips are directly credited in the bank account of the beneficiary. It has immensly helped in targeted delivery of benefits and reducing corruption.\n\nIndustrial Revolution 4.0 brings with it immense potential to improve governance. Its right use will result in improving accountability, access to services, and strengthening of democracy.",

It will also enhance human intelligence networking.\n\n**Way Forward**\n---------------\n\n* Without the development process, there will be no organic end of the causes of discontent and unrest.\n* Social empowerment by means of skills, education, employment opportunities, human rights, rule of law have enough potential in tackling the unfavorable perception among the locals.\n* Also, controlling the misinterpretation of culture, hate speeches and ignorance will enhance the process of persuasion and cognitive change.",

Some of the insurgent groups like the National Socialist Council of Nagaland (NSCN) and the United Liberation Front of Asom (ULFA) operate from Myanmar, which threatens the security of India as well as Myanmar.\u00a0Porous nature of the border provides safe route to human traffickers, illegal arms dealers, drug smugglers etc.\n* **India-Bangladesh Border**: The Indo-Bangladesh Border (4,096 km) passes through West Bengal, Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura, and Mizoram. The entire stretch consists of plains, riverine belts, hills and forests which make illegal migration easy. Illegal migration across this border poses serious security threats and acts as a fertile ground for organizations like the Inter-Services Intelligence of Pakistan to penetrate and expand their activities. Also, the poor law and order situation at the border has led to smuggling of arms and drugs. Supply of arms help in sustaining any conflict.\n* **India-Pakistan Border**: Indo-Pakistan Border (3,323 km) runs along the states of Gujarat, Rajasthan, Punjab and Jammu & Kashmir. Direct accessibility of the borders and some technological developments enabling quick passage of information and transfer of funds has changed the focus and tenor of border security. Cross-border terrorism from Pakistan has exacerbated due to non-recognition of boundaries by its terrorist groups and their success in acquiring legitimacy due to religious or ethnic identity.\n\n**Role played by various security forces in this regard**\n\n* **Assam Rifles**: This force significantly contributed to opening the region to administration and commerce and over time they came to be known as the right arm of the civil and left arm of the military.\n* **Border Security Force**: The BSF has air wing, marine wing, an artillery regiment, and commando units. It currently stands as the world\u2019s largest border guarding force. BSF has been termed as the First Line of Defence of Indian Territories. It is India\u2019s primary border guarding organization on its border with Pakistan and Bangladesh.\n* **Sashastra Seema Bal**: The sole objective of this force is achieving \u2018total security preparedness\u2019 in the remote border areas for performing a \u2018stay-behind\u2019 role in the event of a war. SSB is now spread along the International Border across Uttarakhand, UP, Bihar, West Bengal, Sikkim, Assam, and Arunachal Pradesh.\n\nIndia should endeavor to meaningfully engage with Myanmar, Bangladesh and Pakistan and solicit their cooperation in resolving all outstanding issues and better manage their mutual border.",

It supports appropriate safeguards, access to tax administration in suspicious transaction based on information received from FIUs.\n* The International Organisation of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) takes necessary steps to combat money laundering in securities and futures markets.\n\nMoney Laundering is a global menace which require global effort to curb it.

      "explanation": "Internal security has assumed core importance for India. As India now aspires and rises to taking the high seat in the comity of nations, the security challenges become more compounded and complex. India faces multifold threats from external states and non-state actors on the internal security front. State actors include the foreign government representative and their agencies. Non-state actors may include NGOs, multinational companies, terrorist and religious groups, hackers, etc.\n\n**Challenge posed by external state actors:**\n\n* A few of India\u2019s bordering countries support the insurgent groups through funding, training, or coordination. For example, China is alleged to support insurgents in the North-East.\n* There have been instances where state actors have been responsible for carrying out cyber warfare through hacking and other espionage.\n* State actors also fund their proxies in and out of India to spread instability within the country and tarnish its stature at the global platforms.\n\n**Challenges posed by non-state actors:**\n\n* Multi-national Companies (MNCs) have the potential to threaten national security, especially in the data security and cyberspace domains, and by influencing the policies of their respective governments. It is the reason several Chinese apps were blocked in India recently.\n* Non-state organisations with anarchic and fundamentalist ideologies repugnant to the secularist credentials of India are potential threats to the peaceful internal security environment of the nation.\n* Propagandas are run and funded by enemy countries and other non-state actors (NGOs and civil society organisations) to destabilise India by damaging the socio-religious fabric and ensure riots.\n\n**Following measures shall be undertaken to combat the internal security challenges:**\n\n* There must be effective communication and coordination between intelligence agencies and law enforcement agencies.\n* Sound cyber security measures must be in place to prevent any attempt of cyber attacks.\n* Collaboration should be there between the government, media and the public to ensure quick and efficient sharing of information about suspicious activities to the law enforcement agencies.\n\nWe need to understand national security in a comprehensive sense and not in narrow military terms only. While it is imperative to guard our borders and strengthen our diplomacy, we also need to check the various non-state actors who come in hidden forms. There is a need for a national internal security doctrine to deal with various challenges.",

This can lead to civil violence, of which terrorism may be a part.\n* Terrorist tactics are used not out of a random desire to fire rockets at civilians but to leverage violence to gain specific concessions.\n* Socio-economic explanations of terrorism suggest that various forms of deprivation drive people to terrorism, or that they are more susceptible to recruitment by organisations using terrorist tactics. Poverty, lack of education or lack of political freedom are a few examples.\n* Extreme ideologies may sometime result in hatred towards other sections of society and may lead to terrorism. Examples of terrorist groups motivated by ideology include the Irish Republican Army (IRA) and the Liberation Tigers of Tamal Eelam (LTTE).\n\n**The linkages and obnoxious nexus of terrorism include:**\n\n* Terrorism and organised crime aid each other to thrive and survive. The financial proceeds of organised crime such as extortion/kidnapping are made legal through money laundering and then used to fund terrorist activities.\n* Terrorist groups levy taxes on drug traffickers to provide security to criminals in their controlled area.\n* Terrorist groups act as proxies of enemy governments which in turn provide them funding and shelter.\n\n**The measures undertaken to combat terrorism are:**\n\n* Adoption of a Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism.\n* Strengthening national coordination mechanisms to promote inter-agency participation and information exchange, facilitating joint monitoring, threat assessment.\n* Updating national legislation to ensure that terrorist and organised crime offences are precisely defined.\n* Awareness generation and deradicalization of the youth to wean them away from the clutches of their influencers.",

      "explanation": "Winning of \u2018Hearts and Minds\u2019 refers to the government backed people-centric approach to win support of the local people to restore their trust in the system in conflict ridden regions like Kashmir where goal is to counteract the influence of terrorism.\n\n**Measures adopted by the government with respect to Kashmir**\n\n* **Abrogation of Article 370:** For greater integration of Jammu and Kashmir with rest of India and bringing youth into mainstream, special status of Jammu & Kashmir has been abrogated.\n* **Youth participation:**\n  + Under project *Sadhbhavana*, Army Goodwill Schools (AGS), hostels and vocational courses were launched; teenagers and the elderly were taken on a \u2018Bharat Darshan\u2019 and cricket tournaments were organized for youth in the Valley.\n  + **Project Himayat** was launched for capacity building and **Project Umeed** for empowering J&K women.\n* **Infrastructure Developments:** Emphasis has been laid on creating infrastructure in transportation, health etc. For example, PM\u2019s development package for J&K, Khelo India centers in J&K.\n* **Development of Tourism, Arts and Crafts Sectors:** The new Wool Processing, Handicrafts and Handloom Policy, 2020 has been adopted for promotion and development of handicrafts and handloom sector.\n* **Anti-Radicalisation Drives:** To make people of Kashmir feel less alienated and more incorporated towards Indian cause, anti-radicalisation drives were launched.\n* **Political Engagements:** Engagement with young breed of political leaders for encouraging political dialogues and promoting regional youth participation in local politics is being promoted.\n\nThough the government approach is to restore peace, stability, and development in the region, the situation in Kashmir remains complex. It is high time that government implements more such policies for complete integration of the state's people with the rest of India.",

      "explanation": "An Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) is a \u201cremotely piloted or self-piloted aircraft that can carry cameras, sensors, communications equipment or other payloads like arms/ammunitions, drugs. It can be used by our adversaries across the border and can be a serious threat to internal security.\n\n**Cause of concern**\n\n* They can fly at high altitudes and low speeds making it difficult for border security forces to detect and intercept them.\n* They can be remotely controlled and flown from a safe distance, reducing the risk to human operatives engaging in infiltration attempts.\n* Drones can also be used for espionage purposes, allowing unauthorized individuals to gather sensitive information about military installations, critical infrastructure, and other key targets.\n\n**Measures taken by Indian government to tackle threats**\n\n* **Technological Upgradation:** Deployment of anti-drone weapons, detection systems like radars, jammers, e.g., anti-drone systems like the SkyWall 100 and the DroneGun Tactical CHIMERA anti-drone system, developed using French technology.\n* **Military Intelligence**: The BSF conducts round-the-clock surveillance through patrolling, checkpoints, and observation posts, erected a border fence and installed floodlights.\n* **Institutional:** MHA has established Anti Rogue Drone Technology Committee (ARDTC) to evaluate the technology available to counter rogue drones.\n* **Governmental Collaboration:** Active collaboration with countries like Israel for high end drones.\n* **DRDO Nishant:** Primarily designed for intelligence-gathering over enemy territory, it is also used for reconnaissance, training, surveillance, target designation, artillery fire correction, and damage assessment.\n* **Counter-Unmanned Aircraft Systems (C-UAS) strategy:** It includes blocking communication lines and bringing down unwanted drones.\n\nWith the emergence of technology comes the threat to internal security. Therefore, a comprehensive drone strategy that includes private participation for developing high end drones is the need of an hour.",

Narco-terrorism** is increasingly linked to the **narcotics-producing** regions of the **Golden Crescent** and the **Golden Triangle.**\n\n### Body\n\n* **Narco-terrerism as Threat:**\n  + It creates a dual **threat of violence** and **organized crime, destabilizing nations, corrupting institutions**, and **fostering insecurity by financing insurgencies, cartels, and extremist networks** globally.\n  + **Northeast states of India, Punjab** and **Jammu & Kashmir** are the major Indian states which are suffering with narco-terrerism.\n  + In India, drug trafficking networks exploit **porous borders, particularly** with **Afghanistan and Myanmar,** to finance terrorism.\n* **Measures to Counter Narco-Terrorism**\n  + **Enhanced Border Surveillance:** Strengthen border security using advanced technologies like **drones, satellite imagery, and AI-based surveillance systems** to curb drug smuggling.\n  + **Financial Monitoring**: Implement robust financial intelligence mechanisms to trace and disrupt narcotic-linked terrorist funding.\n  + **International Cooperation:** Bolster transnational partnerships through organizations like the UNODC and Interpol to dismantle global narco-terror networks.\n  + **Public Awareness and Rehabilitation:** Conduct **anti-drug awareness campaigns** and establish **de-addiction programs** to weaken the consumer base.\n  + **Legal Reforms:** Strengthen laws for stricter punishment against drug traffickers and terror financiers.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nA Multi-faceted approach is essential to counter narco-terrorism. Strengthening border security, enhancing international cooperation, and implementing stringent anti-money laundering measures such as Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 are crucial. Additionally, addressing socio-economic issues, promoting alternative livelihoods, and investing in education can help reduce the appeal of drug trafficking and terrorism, fostering long-term stability.",
