Your answers to these items should be based on the passage only.    PASSAGE    A country under foreign domination seeks escape from the present in dreams of a vanished age, and finds consolation in visions of past greatness. That is a foolish and dangerous  pastime in which many of us indulge. An equally questionable practice for us in India is to imagine that we are still spiritually great  though we have come down in the world in other respects. Spiritual or any other greatness cannot be founded on lack of freedom  and opportunity, or on starvation and misery. Many western  writers have encouraged that notion that Indians are other-worldly. I suppose the poor and unfortunate in every country become to some extent other-worldly, unless they become  revolutionaries, for this world is evidently not meant for them. So also subject peoples.     As a man grows to maturity he is not entirely engrossed in, or satisfied with, the external objective world. He seeks also  some inner meaning, some psychological and physical satisfaction.  So also with peoples and civilizations as they mature and grow  adult.  Every civilization and every people exhibit these parallel  streams of an external life and an internal life. Where they meet or  keep close to each other, there is an equilibrium and stability. When they diverge conflict arises and the crises that torture the  mind and spirit.",

Your answers to these items should be based on the passage only.    PASSAGE   A species that exerts an influence out of proportion to its abundance in an ecosystem is called a keystone species. The keystone species may influence both the species richness of communities and the flow of energy and materials through ecosystems. The sea star Pisaster ochraceus, which lives in rocky intertidal ecosystems on the Pacific coast of North America, isalso an example of a keystone species. Its preferred prey is the mussel Mytilus californianus. In the absence of sea stars, these mussels crowd out other competitors in a broad belt of the intertidal zone. By consuming mussels, sea star creates bare spaces that are taken over by a variety of other species.    A study at the University of Washington demonstrated the influence of Pisaster on species richness by removing sea stars from selected parts of the intertidal zone repeatedly over a period of five years. Two major changes occurred in the areas from  whichsea stars were removed. First, the lower edge of the mussel  bed  extended farther down into the intertidal zone, showing  that sea stars are able to eliminate mussels completely where they are covered with water most of the time. Second, and more dramatically, 28 species of animals and algae disappeared  from the sea star removal zone. Eventually only Mytilus, the dominant competitor, occupied the entire substratum. Through its effect on competitive relationships, predation by Pisaster largely determines which species live in these rocky intertidal ecosystems.",

The mother bear has fasted for as long as eight months but that does not stop the young from demanding full access to her remaining reserves. If there are triplets, the most persistent stands to gain an extra meal and it may have the meal at the expense of others. The smallest of the litter forfeits many meals to stronger siblings. Females are protective of their cubs but tend to ignore family rivalry over food. In 21 years of photographing polar bears, I\u2019ve only once seen the smallest of triplets survive  till autumn.",

Your answers to these items should be based on the passage only.    PASSAGE    A country under foreign domination seeks escape from the present in dreams of a vanished age, and finds consolation in visions of past greatness. That is a foolish and dangerous  pastime in which many of us indulge. An equally questionable practice for us in India is to imagine that we are still spiritually great  though we have come down in the world in other respects. Spiritual or any other greatness cannot be founded on lack of freedom  and opportunity, or on starvation and misery. Many western  writers have encouraged that notion that Indians are other-worldly. I suppose the poor and unfortunate in every country become to some extent other-worldly, unless they become  revolutionaries, for this world is evidently not meant for them. So also subject peoples.     As a man grows to maturity he is not entirely engrossed in, or satisfied with, the external objective world. He seeks also  some inner meaning, some psychological and physical satisfaction.  So also with peoples and civilizations as they mature and grow  adult.  Every civilization and every people exhibit these parallel  streams of an external life and an internal life. Where they meet or  keep close to each other, there is an equilibrium and stability. When they diverge conflict arises and the crises that torture the  mind and spirit.",

Your answers to these items should be based on the passage only.    PASSAGE   A species that exerts an influence out of proportion to its abundance in an ecosystem is called a keystone species. The keystone species may influence both the species richness of communities and the flow of energy and materials through ecosystems. The sea star Pisaster ochraceus, which lives in rocky intertidal ecosystems on the Pacific coast of North America, isalso an example of a keystone species. Its preferred prey is the mussel Mytilus californianus. In the absence of sea stars, these mussels crowd out other competitors in a broad belt of the intertidal zone. By consuming mussels, sea star creates bare spaces that are taken over by a variety of other species.    A study at the University of Washington demonstrated the influence of Pisaster on species richness by removing sea stars from selected parts of the intertidal zone repeatedly over a period of five years. Two major changes occurred in the areas from  whichsea stars were removed. First, the lower edge of the mussel  bed  extended farther down into the intertidal zone, showing  that sea stars are able to eliminate mussels completely where they are covered with water most of the time. Second, and more dramatically, 28 species of animals and algae disappeared  from the sea star removal zone. Eventually only Mytilus, the dominant competitor, occupied the entire substratum. Through its effect on competitive relationships, predation by Pisaster largely determines which species live in these rocky intertidal ecosystems.",

The mother bear has fasted for as long as eight months but that does not stop the young from demanding full access to her remaining reserves.

      "question_para": "PASSAGE-2     Chemical pesticides lose their role in sustainable agriculture if the pests evolve resistance. The evolution of pesticide resistance is simply natural selection in action. It is almost  certain to occur when vast numbers of a genetically variable  population are killed. One or a few individuals may be unusually resistant (perhaps because they possess an enzyme that can detoxify  the pesticide). If the pesticide is applied repeatedly, each  successive generation of the pest will contain a larger proportion of  resistant individuals. Pests typically have a high intrinsic rate of reproduction, and so a few individuals in one generation may give rise to hundreds or thousands in the next, and resistance spreads very rapidly in a population.      This problem was often ignored in the past, even though the first case of DDT (dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane)  resistance was reported early as 1946. There is exponential increase in  the numbers of invertebrates that have evolved resistance and in  the number of pesticides against which resistance has evolved. Resistance has been recorded in every family of arthropod  pests (including dipterans such as mosquitoes and house flies, as  well as beetles, moths, wasps, fleas, lice and mites) as well as in  weeds and plant pathogens. Take the Alabama leaf-worm, a moth  pest of cotton, as an example. It has developed resistance in one or  more   regions of the world to aldrin, DDT, dieldrin, endrin, lindane and toxaphene.    If chemical pesticides brought nothing but, problems, \u2014 if their use was intrinsically and acutely unsustainable \u2014 then  they would already have fallen out of widespread use. This has not happened. Instead, their rate of production has increased  rapidly.  The ratio of cost to benefit for the individual agricultural  producer has remained in favour of pesticide use. In the USA,  insecticides have been estimated to benefit the agricultural products to  the tune of around  $5 for every $1 spent.     Moreover, in many poorer countries, the prospect of imminent mass starvation, or of an epidemic disease, are so frightening that the social and health costs of using pesticides have to be ignored. In general the use of pesticides is justified   by objective measures such as \u2018lives saved\u2019, \u2018economic efficiency of food production\u2019 and \u2018total food produced\u2019. In these very fundamental senses, their use may be described as  sustainable.    In practice, sustainability depends on continually developing  new pesticides that keep at least one step ahead of the pests \u2013 pesticides that are less persistent, biodegradable and more accurately targeted all the pests.",

      "question_para": "PASSAGE-2   Most champions of democracy have been rather reticent in suggesting that democracy would itself promote development and enhancement of social welfare\u2013they have tended to see  them as good but distinctly separate and largely independent goals. The detractors of democracy, on the other hand, seemed to  have been quite willing to express their diagnosis of what they see  as serious tensions between democracy and development. The theorists of the practical split \u2014 \u2018\u2018Make up your mind : do you want democracy, or instead, do you want development ?\u2019\u2019 \u2014 often came, at least to start with, from East Asian countries,  and their voice grew in influence as several of these countries were immensely successful \u2013 through the 1970s and 1980s and  even later \u2013 in promoting economic growth without pursuing democracy.    To deal with these issues we have to pay particular attention to both the content of what can be called development and to  the interpretation of democracy (in particular to the respective  roles of voting and of public reasoning). The assessment of development cannot be divorced from the lives that people  can lead and the real freedom that they enjoy. Development can scarcely be seen merely in terms of enhancement of  inanimate objects of convenience, such as a rise in the GNP (or in personal incomes), or industrialization \u2013 important as they may be as means to the real ends. Their value must depend on what they do to the lives and freedom of the people involved, which must be central to the idea of development.   If development is understood in a broader way, with a focus on human lives, then it becomes immediately clear that the  relation between development and democracy has to be seen partly  in terms of their constitutive connection, rather than only through their external links. Even though the question has often been asked whether political freedom is \u2018\u2018conducive to development\u2019\u2019, we must not miss the crucial recognition that political liberties and democratic rights are among the \u201cconstituent components\u201d of development.

      "question_para": "PASSAGE-3   The need for Competition Law becomes more evident when foreign direct investment (FDI) is liberalized. The impact of FDI  is not always pro-competitive. Very often FDI takes the form of a foreign corporation acquiring a domestic enterprise or  establishing a joint venture with one. By making such an acquisition the  foreign investor may substantially lessen competition and gain a dominant position in the relevant market, thus charging  higher prices. Another scenario is where the affiliates of two separate multinational companies (MNCs) have been established in competition with one another in a particular developing  economy, following the liberalization of FDI. Subsequently, the parent companies overseas merge. With the affiliates no longer  remaining independent, competition in the host country may be virtually eliminated and the prices of the products may be artificially inflated.    Most of these adverse consequences of mergers and acquisitions by MNCs can be avoided if an effective competition law is in place. Also, an economy that has implemented an effective competition law is in a better position to attract FDI than one that has not. This is not just because most MNCs are expected to be accustomed to the operation of such a law in their home countries and know how to deal with such concerns but also that MNCs expect competition authorities to ensure a level playing field between domestic and foreign firms .",

      "question_para": "PASSAGE-2  In a typical Western liberal context, deepening of democracy invariably leads to consolidation of 'liberal values'. In the  Indian context, democratization is translated into greater  involvement of people not as 'individuals' which is a staple to liberal  discourse, but as communities or groups. Individuals are getting involved in the public sphere not as \u2018atomized\u2019 individuals but as members of primordial communities drawn on religious or caste identity.     Community-identity seems to be the governing force. It is not therefore surprising that the so-called peripheral groups  continue to maintain their identities with reference to the social groups (caste, religion or sect) to which they belong while getting involved in the political processes despite the fact that their political goals remain more or less identical. By helping to  articulate the political voice of the marginalized, democracy in India has  led to \u2018a loosening of social strictures\u2019 and empowered the  peripherals to be confident of their ability to improve the socio-economic conditions in which they are placed. This is a significant  political process that had led to a silent revolution through a  meaningful transfer of power from the upper caste elites to various  subaltern groups within the democratic framework of public  governance.",

Your answers to these items should be based on the passage only.    PASSAGE   Ecological research over the last quarter of the century has established the deleterious effects of habitat fragmentation  due to mining, highways and such other intrusions on forests.  When a large block of forests gets fragmented into smaller bits, the edges of all these bits come into contact with human activities resulting in the degradation of the entire forests. Continuity of forested landscapes and corridors gets disrupted affecting  several extinction-prone species of wildlife. Habitat fragmentation is therefore considered as the most serious threat to biodiversity conservation. Ad hoc grants of forest lands to mining  companies coupled with rampant illegal mining is aggravating this threat.",

Your answers to these items should bebased on the passage only.     PASSAGE-1   The law in many parts of the world increasingly restricts the discharge of agricultural slurry into watercourses. The  simplest and often the most economically sound practice returns the material to the land as semisolid manure or as sprayed slurry. This dilutes its concentration in the environment to what  might have occurred in a more primitive and sustainable types of agriculture and converts pollutant into fertilizer. Soil microoganisms decompose the organic components of  sewage and slurry and most of the mineral nutrients become available to be absorbed again by the vegetation.   The excess input of nutrients, both nitrogen and phosphorus \u2013 based, agricultural runoff (and human sewage) has caused  many \u2018healthy\u2019 oligotrophic lakes (low nutrient concentrations, low plant productivity with abundant water weeds, and clear  water) to change to eutrophic condition where high nutrient inputs  lead to high phytoplankton productivity (sometimes dominated by bloom-forming toxic species). This makes the water turbid, eliminates large plants and, in the worst situations, leads to  anoxia and fish kills; so called cultural eutrophication. Thus,  important ecosystem services are lost, including the provisioning service of wild-caught fish and the cultural services associated with recreation.  The process of cultural eutrophication of lakes has been understood for some time. But only recently did scientists  notice huge \u2018dead zones\u2019 in the oceans near river outlets.,  particularly those draining large catchment areas such as the Mississippi in North America and the Yangtze in China. The nutrient-enriched water flows through streams, rivers and lakes, and eventually to the estuary and ocean where the ecological impact may be huge, killing virtually all invertebrates and fish in areas up to 70,000 km\u200c2  in extent. More than 150 sea areas worldwide are now regularly starved of oxygen as a result of decomposition of algal blooms, fuelled particularly by nitrogen from agricultural runoff of fertilizers and sewage from large cities. Oceanic dead zones are typically associated with industrialized nations and usually lie off countries that subsidize their agriculture, encouraging farmers to increases productivity and use more fertilizer.",

      "question_para": "PASSAGE-4   A number of empirical studies find that farmers are risk-averse,  though only moderately in many cases. There is also evidence to show that farmers\u2019 risk aversion results in  cropping patterns and input use designed to reduce risk rather than to maximize income. Farmers adopt a number of strategies to  manage and cope with agricultural risks. These include practices like  crop and field diversification, non-farm \u2018employment storage of stocks and strategic migration of family members. There are also institutions ranging from share tenancy to kinship, extended  family and informal credit agencies. One major obstacle to risk  sharing by farmers is that the same type of risks can affect a large number of farmers in the region. Empirical studies show that the traditional methods are not adequate. Hence there is a need for policy interventions, especially measures that cut across  geographical regions.     Polices may aim at tackling agricultural risks directly or  indirectly.     Examples of risk-specific policies are crop insurance, price stabilization and the development of varieties resistant to  pests and diseases. Policies which affect risk indirectly are irrigation, subsidized credit and access to information. No single risk- specific policy is sufficient to reduce risk and is without side-effects, whereas policies not specific to risk influence the general  situation and affect risks only indirectly. Crop insurance, as a policy measure to tackle agricultural risk directly, deserves careful consideration in the Indian context and in many other  developing countries \u2013 because the majority of farmers depend on rain- fed agriculture and in many areas yield variability is the  predominant cause of their income instability.",

      "question_para": "Passage - 2   Net profits are only 2.2% of their total assets for central public sector undertakings, lower than for the private corporate  sector.     While the public sector or the State-led entrepreneurship  played an important role in triggering India's industrialization, our  evolving development needs, comparatively less-than-satisfactory performance of the public sector enterprises, the maturing of  our private sector, a much larger social base now available for expanding entrepreneurship and the growing institutional capabilities to enforce competition policies would suggest  that the time has come to review the role of public sector.   What should the portfolio composition of the government  be ? It should not remain static all times. The airline industry  works well as a purely private affair. At the opposite end, rural  roads, whose sparse traffic makes tolling unviable, have to be on  the balance-sheet of the State. If the government did not own  rural roads, they would not exist. Similarly, public health capital  in our towns and cities will need to come from the public sector. Equally, preservation and improvement of forest cover will have to be a new priority for the public sector assets.   Take the example of steel. With near-zero tariffs, India is a globally competitive market for the metal. Indian firms  export steel into the global market, which demonstrates there is no gap  in technology. Indian companies are buying up global steel companies, which shows there is no gap in capital  availability. Under these conditions, private ownership works best.    Private ownership is clearly desirable in regulated industries, ranging from finance to infrastructure, where a government agency performs the function of regulation and multiple competing firms are located in the private sector. Here, the simple and clean solution - government as the umpire and the private sector as the players is what works best. In many of these industries, we have a legacy of government ownership, where productivity tends to be lower, fear of bankruptcy is absent, and the risk of asking for money from the tax payer is ever present. There is also the conflict  of interest between government as an owner and as the regulator. The formulation and implementation of competition policy will be more vigorous and fair if government companies are out of action.",

Your answers to these items should be based  on the passages only.    Passage - 1  The Himalayan ecosystem is highly vulnerable to damage, both due to geological reasons and on account of the stress caused by increased pressure of population, exploitation of natural resources and other related challenges. These aspects may be exacerbated due to the impact of climate change. It is possible that climate change may adversely impact the Himalayan ecosystem  through increased temperature, altered precipitation patterns,  episodes of drought and biotic influences. This would not only impact the very sustenance of the indigenous communities in uplands  but also the life of downstream dwellers across the country and beyond. Therefore, there is an urgent need for giving special attention to sustain the Himalayan ecosystem. This would  require conscious efforts for conserving all the representative  systems.    Further, it needs to be emphasized that the endemics with restricted distribution, and most often with specialized habitat requirements, are among the most vulnerable elements. In  this respect the Himalayan biodiversity hotspot, with rich endemic diversity, is vulnerable to climate change. The threats include possible loss of genetic resources and species, habitats and concomitantly a decrease in ecosystem services. Therefore, conservation of endemic elements inrepresentative  ecosystems/ habitats assumes a great significance while drawing  conservation plans for the region.  Towards achieving the above, we will have to shift toward contemporary conservation approaches, which include a  paradigm of landscape level interconnectivity between protected area systems. The concept advocates a shift from the species- habitat focus to an inclusive focus on expanding the biogeographic  range  so that natural adjustments to climate change can proceed  without being restrictive.",

      "question_para": "Passage -2   It is often forgotten that globalization is not only about policies on international economic relationships and transactions, but  has equally to do with domestic policies of a nation. Policy changes necessitated by meeting the internationally set conditions (by WTO etc.) of free trade and investment flows obviously affect domestic producers and investors. But the basic philosophy underlying globalization emphasizes absolute freedom to  markets to determine prices and production and distribution patterns,  and view government interventions as processes that create distortions and bring in inefficiency. Thus, public enterprises  have to be privatized through disinvestments and sales; sectors and activities   hitherto reserved for the public sector have to be opened to  the private sector. This logic extends to the social services like education and health. Any restrictions on the adjustments  in workforce by way of retrenchment of workers should also  be removed and exit should be made easier by removing any restrictions on closures. Employment and wages should be governed by free play of market forces, as any measure to  regulate them can discourage investment and also create  inefficiency in production. Above all, in line with the overall philosophy of reduction in the role of the State, fiscal reforms should be undertaken to have generally low levels of taxation and  government expenditure should be kept to the minimum to abide by the  principle of fiscal prudence. All these are policy actions on the  domestic front and are not directly related to the core items of the globalization agenda, namely free international flow of  goods and finance.",

In fact I can see that, on the contrary, it has been all to my advantage. My hesitancy in speech, which was once an annoyance, is now a pleasure. Its greatest benefit has been  that it has taught me the economy of words. I have naturally formed the habit of restraining my thoughts. And I can now give myself the certificate that a thoughtless word hardly ever escapes my tongue or pen. I do not recollect ever having had to regret anything in my speech or writing. I have thus been spared many a mishap and waste of time. Experience has taught me that silence is part of  the spiritual discipline of a votary of truth. Proneness to  exaggerate, to suppress or modify the truth, wittingly or unwittingly, is a natural weakness of man, and silence is necessary in order to surmount it. A man of few words will rarely be thoughtless in  his speech; he will measure every word. We find so many people impatient to talk. There is no chairman of a meeting who is not pestered with notes for permission to speak. And whenever  the permission is given the speaker generally exceeds the time- limit, asks for more time, and keeps on talking without permission.  1 All this talking can hardly be said to be of any benefit to the  world. It is so much waste of time. My shyness has been in reality my shield and buckler. It has allowed me to grow. It has helped  me in my discernment of truth.",

To save, individuals need access to safe and reliable financial institutions, such as banks, and to appropriate financial instruments and reasonable  financial incentives. Such access is not always available to all people in developing countries like India and more so, in rural areas.  Savings help poor households manage volatility in cash flow,  smoothen consumption, and build working capital. Poor households  without access to a formal savings mechanism encourage immediate spending temptations.",

Your answers to these items should be based on the passages only.   PASSAGE-1   Biomass as fuel for power, heat, and transport has the highest mitigation potential of all renewable sources. It comes from agriculture and forest residues as well as from energy crops. The biggest challenge in using biomass residues is a long-term reliable supply delivered to the power plant at reasonable costs; the key problems are logistical constraints and the costs of fuel collection. Energy crops, if not managed properly, compete with food production and may have undesirable impacts on food prices. Biomass production is also sensitive to the physical impacts of a changing climate.  Projections of the future role of biomass are probably overestimated, given the limits to the sustainable biomass supply, unless breakthrough technologies substantially increase productivity. Climate-energy models project that biomass use could increase nearly four-fold to around 150\u2212200 exajoules, almost a quarter of world primary energy in 2050. However the maximum sustainable technical potential of biomass (both residues and energy crops) without disruption of food and forest resources ranges from 80\u2212 170 exajoules a year by 2050, and only part of this is realistically and economically feasible. In addition, some climate models rely on biomass-based carbon capture and storage, an unproven technology, to achieve negative emissions and to buy some time during the first half of the century.   Some liquid biofuels such as corn-based ethanol, mainly for transport, may aggravate rather than ameliorate carbon emissions on a life-cycle basis. Second generation biofuels, based on ligno-cellulosic feedstocks- such as straw, bagasse, grass and wood - hold the promise of sustainable production that is high-yielding and emit low levels of greenhouse gases, but these are still in the R&D stage.",

Your answers to these items should be based on the passages only.   PASSAGE-1   Biomass as fuel for power, heat, and transport has the highest mitigation potential of all renewable sources. It comes from agriculture and forest residues as well as from energy crops. The biggest challenge in using biomass residues is a long-term reliable supply delivered to the power plant at reasonable costs; the key problems are logistical constraints and the costs of fuel collection. Energy crops, if not managed properly, compete with food production and may have undesirable impacts on food prices. Biomass production is also sensitive to the physical impacts of a changing climate.  Projections of the future role of biomass are probably overestimated, given the limits to the sustainable biomass supply, unless breakthrough technologies substantially increase productivity. Climate-energy models project that biomass use could increase nearly four-fold to around 150\u2212200 exajoules, almost a quarter of world primary energy in 2050. However the maximum sustainable technical potential of biomass (both residues and energy crops) without disruption of food and forest resources ranges from 80\u2212 170 exajoules a year by 2050, and only part of this is realistically and economically feasible. In addition, some climate models rely on biomass-based carbon capture and storage, an unproven technology, to achieve negative emissions and to buy some time during the first half of the century.   Some liquid biofuels such as corn-based ethanol, mainly for transport, may aggravate rather than ameliorate carbon emissions on a life-cycle basis. Second generation biofuels, based on ligno-cellulosic feedstocks- such as straw, bagasse, grass and wood - hold the promise of sustainable production that is high-yielding and emit low levels of greenhouse gases, but these are still in the R&D stage.",

The quotas have imposed a debate on issues of social integration and equity in education that private actors had escaped by and large.

When people, thanks to lower tax rates, are allowed to retain most of the higher income that they gain from each incremental level of education, it makes eminent sense to invest in education. On the other hand, when the government decides to tax the higher income of educated individuals at even higher rates, it makes very little sense to invest in educating oneself further. The same incentives apply to parents who decide on whether to invest in their children's education.  With reference to the above passage, the following assumptions have been made:  1. Lower tax rates in a country invariably translate into greater investments in higher education.  2. Investment in the education of children ensures their economic freedom.  3. Economic freedom has a positive impact on building up human capital.  Which of the above assumptions is/are valid?",

Water delivery requires heavy investment in collecting it from a natural source, treating it to make it potable, and laying a distribution network of pipes for delivery to the users. It also requires investments in sewerage infrastructure and sewage treatment plants so that the sewers can carry the wastewater to these plants to ensure that no untreated sewage is discharged back into natural water bodies. If our cities were rich enough to meet the entire cost, water could be delivered free. They are not.",

But even democracy ruins itself by excess of democracy. Its basic principle is the equal right of all to hold office and determine public policy.

The people have no understanding and only repeat what their rulers are pleased to tell them. Such a democracy is tyranny or autocracy - PlatoWhich one of the following statements best reflects the crux of the passage given above?",

According to studies, they are anywhere from 5-15% less productive than they could be, as a result thereof. India also has the largest tuberculosis burden in the world, costing 170 million workdays to the country annually. But what is just as important as lost productivity now is lost potential in the future. It is becoming increasingly clear that on many measures of cognitive ability, malnourished Indian children perform two or three times worse than their adequately nourished peers. For an economy that\u00a0will be more dependent on highly skilled workers, this poses a significant challenge. And it is one that really should be addressed given India's demographic outlook.",
