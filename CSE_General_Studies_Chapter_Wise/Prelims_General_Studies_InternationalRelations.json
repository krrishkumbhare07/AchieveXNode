PASSAGE    A country under foreign domination seeks escape from the present in dreams of a vanished age, and finds consolation in visions of past greatness. That is a foolish and dangerous  pastime in which many of us indulge. An equally questionable practice for us in India is to imagine that we are still spiritually great  though we have come down in the world in other respects. Spiritual or any other greatness cannot be founded on lack of freedom  and opportunity, or on starvation and misery. Many western  writers have encouraged that notion that Indians are other-worldly. I suppose the poor and unfortunate in every country become to some extent other-worldly, unless they become  revolutionaries, for this world is evidently not meant for them. So also subject peoples.     As a man grows to maturity he is not entirely engrossed in, or satisfied with, the external objective world. He seeks also  some inner meaning, some psychological and physical satisfaction.  So also with peoples and civilizations as they mature and grow  adult.  Every civilization and every people exhibit these parallel  streams of an external life and an internal life. Where they meet or  keep close to each other, there is an equilibrium and stability.

Your answers to these items should be based on the passages only.       PASSAGE-1    Invasions of exotic species into new geographic areas  sometimes occur naturally and without human agency.   However, human actions have increased this trickle to a flood. Human- caused introductions may occur either accidentally as a consequence of human transport, or intentionally but illegally  to serve some private purpose or legitimately to procure some  hoped for public benefit by bringing a pest under control,  producing  new agricultural products or providing novel recreational opportunities. Many introduced species are assimilated into communities without much obvious effect. However, some  have been responsible for dramatic changes to native species and natural communities. For example, the accidental introduction  of the brown tree snake Boiga irregularis into Guam, an island in the Pacific, has through nest predation reduced 10 endemic  forest bird species to the point of extinction.    One of the major reasons for the world's great biodiversity is the occurrence of centers of endemism so that similar  habitats in different parts of the world are occupied by different  groups of species that happen to have evolved there. If every species naturally had access to everywhere on the globe, we might  expect a relatively small number of successful species to become  dominant in each biome. The extent to which this homogenization can happen naturally is restricted by the limited powers of  dispersal of most species in the face of the physical barriers that exist  to dispersal. By virtue of the transport opportunities offered  by humans, these barriers have been breached by an ever- increasing number of exotic species. The effects of introductions have  been to convert a hugely diverse range of local community compositions into something much more homogeneous.   It would be wrong, however, to conclude that introducing species to a region will inevitably cause a decline in species richness there. For example, there are numerous species of  plants,  invertebrates and vertebrates found in continental Europe  but  absent from the British Isles (many because they have so  far  failed to recolonize after the last glaciations). Their  introduction would be likely to augment British biodiversity. The   significant detrimental effect noted above arises where aggressive  species provide a novel challenge to endemic biotas ill-equipped to  deal with them",

Your answer to these items should be  based on the passage only.     PASSAGE-1   The subject of democracy has become severely muddled because of the way the rhetoric surrounding it has been used   in recent years. There is, increasingly, an oddly confused  dichotomy between those who want to \u2018impose\u2019 democracy on countries  in the non-Western world (in these countries\u2019 \u2018own interest\u2019, of course) and those who are opposed to such \u2018imposition\u2019  (because of the respect for the countries\u2019 \u2018own ways\u2019). But the entire language of \u2018imposition\u2019, used by both sides, is extraordinarily inappropriate since it makes the implicit assumption that democracy belongs exclusively to the West, taking it to be a quintessentialy \u2018Wester\u2019 idea which has originated and  flourished only in the West.     But the thesis and the pessimism it generates about the  possibility of democratic practice in the world would be extremely hard  to justify. There were several experiments in local democracy in ancient India. Indeed, in understanding the roots of  democracy in the world, we have to take an interest in the history of  people participation and public reasoning in different parts of the  world.     We have to look beyond thinking of democracy only in terms  of European and American evolution. We would fail to  understand the pervasive demands for participatory living, on which  Aristotle spoke with far-reaching insight, if we take democracy to be a  kind of a specialized cultural product of the West.    It cannot, of course, be doubted that the institutional structure of the contemporary practice of democracy is largely the product of European and American experience over the last few centuries. This is extremely important to recognize since these development in institutional formats were immensely innovative and ultimately effective. There can be little doubt that there is a major \u2018Western\u2019 achievement here.",

Your answers to these items should be based  on the passages only.    Passage - 1  Many nations now place their faith in capitalism and  governments choose it as the strategy to create wealth for their people. The spectacular economic growth seen in Brazil, China and India  after the liberalisation of their economies is proof of its enormous potential and success. However, the global banking crisis and  the economic recession have left many bewildered. The debates  tend to focus on free market operations and forces, their efficiency  and their ability for self correction. Issues of justice, integrity and honesty are rarely elaborated to highlight the failure of the  global banking system. The apologists of the system continue to  justify the success of capitalism and argue that the recent crisis was a blip.  Their arguments betray an ideological bias/ with the assumptions that an unregulated market is fair and  competent, and that the exercise of private greed will be in the larger .  public interest.   Few recognize the bidirectional relationship between  capitalism and greed; that each reinforces the other. Surely, a more  honest conceptualisation of the conflicts of interest among the rich  and powerful players who have benefited from the system, their  biases and ideology is needed; the focus on the wealth creation  should also highlight the resultant gross inequity.",

Its yield (about 2000kg\u2215 hectare ) will be significantly greater than those of the existing varieties and because its size will be uniform, it will be amenable to mechanical harvesting, an attractive feature for farmers in northern India who currently use this technology for paddy. Most important, Arhar straw, unlike paddy straw, is green and can be ploughed back into the soil. In paddy straw, the problem is the high silica content, which does not allow for easy decomposition. In the case of Arhar, the farmer, even after combine harvesting, just needs to run a rotovator to cut the leftover straw into pieces, which can be ploughed back and will decompose very fast. All this is difficult with leftover paddy stalks that cannot be easily salvaged or ploughed back. Farmers, therefore, choose the easiest option of simply burning it.      Which of the following are the most rational inferences that can be made from the passage?  1. Farmers' income will be higher with pulse cultivation than with paddy cultivation.  2. Pulse cultivation causes less pollution as compared to paddy cultivation.  3. Pulse straw can be used to improve soil quality.  4. In the context of northern Indian agriculture, paddy straw has no usefulness.  5. Mechanized agriculture is the main cause for stubble burning.

Passage-1    Bank credit to the industrial sector has started shrinking. Its decline has been a serious concern as credit growth is essential to revive investment. The problem's origins lie in the incomplete reforms of the last 25 years. An institutional change that should have followed the 1991 reforms should have been setting up of a resolution corporation for banks. In a market economy with booms and busts, banks should be allowed to be set up and to fail. Today, we cannot shut down banks because there is no proper system to shut them down. Weak loss-making banks continue to need more capital.     Which one of the following is the most logical and rational inference that can be made from the above passage?",

Your answers to these items should be based on the passages only.Can a democracy avoid being a welfare state for long ? Why cannot mass welfare be left entirely to the markets ? There is a built-in tension between markets and democracy. Markets do not work on a one-person-one-vote principle as democracies do. What one gets out of the market place depends on one\u2019s endowments, skills, purchasing power and the forces of demand and supply. Markets reward individual initiative and skill, and may also lift many from the bottom rungs of society, but some people never get the opportunity to develop skills that markets demand; they are simply too poor and too handicapped; or skill formation takes too long. By creating jobs, markets may be able to help even unskilled people, but capitalism has always witnessed bursts of unemployment.With reference to the above passage, the following assumptions have been made :1. Modern democracies rely on the forces to enable them to be welfare states.2. Markets ensure sufficient economic growth necessary for democracies to be effective.3. Government programmes are needed for those left behind in economic growth.Which of the above assumptions is/are valid ?",
