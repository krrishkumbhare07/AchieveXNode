Your answers to these items should be based on the passage only.    PASSAGE   A species that exerts an influence out of proportion to its abundance in an ecosystem is called a keystone species. The keystone species may influence both the species richness of communities and the flow of energy and materials through ecosystems. The sea star Pisaster ochraceus, which lives in rocky intertidal ecosystems on the Pacific coast of North America, isalso an example of a keystone species. Its preferred prey is the mussel Mytilus californianus. In the absence of sea stars, these mussels crowd out other competitors in a broad belt of the intertidal zone. By consuming mussels, sea star creates bare spaces that are taken over by a variety of other species.    A study at the University of Washington demonstrated the influence of Pisaster on species richness by removing sea stars from selected parts of the intertidal zone repeatedly over a period of five years. Two major changes occurred in the areas from  whichsea stars were removed. First, the lower edge of the mussel  bed  extended farther down into the intertidal zone, showing  that sea stars are able to eliminate mussels completely where they are covered with water most of the time. Second, and more dramatically, 28 species of animals and algae disappeared  from the sea star removal zone. Eventually only Mytilus, the dominant competitor, occupied the entire substratum. Through its effect on competitive relationships, predation by Pisaster largely determines which species live in these rocky intertidal ecosystems.",
      "question_text": "With reference to the passage, consider the following statements :   1. Mussels are generally the dominant species in intertidal ecosystems.   2. The survival of sea stars is generally determined by the abundance of mussels.   Which of the statements given above is/are correct ?",

PASSAGE-1    Ecosystems provide people with a variety of goods and services; food, clean water, clean air, flood control, soil stabilization,pollination, climate regulation, spiritual fulfilment and aesthetic enjoyment, to name just a few. Most of these benefits either  are irreplaceable or the technology necessary to replace them is prohibitively expensive. For example, potable fresh water can  be provided by desalinating sea-water, but only at great cost.     The rapidly expanding human population has greatly modified the Earth's ecosystems to meet their increased requirements  of some of the goods and services, particularly food, fresh water, timber, fibre and fuel. These modifications have contributed substantially to human well being and economic development.The benefits have not been equally distributed. Some people have actually been harmed by these changes. Moreover, short-term increases in some ecosystem goods and services have come at the cost of the long-term degradation of  others. For example, efforts to increase the production of food and fibre have decreased the ability of some ecosystems to provide clean water, regulate flooding and support biodiversity.",

Your answers to these items should be based on the passage only.    PASSAGE   A species that exerts an influence out of proportion to its abundance in an ecosystem is called a keystone species. The keystone species may influence both the species richness of communities and the flow of energy and materials through ecosystems. The sea star Pisaster ochraceus, which lives in rocky intertidal ecosystems on the Pacific coast of North America, isalso an example of a keystone species. Its preferred prey is the mussel Mytilus californianus. In the absence of sea stars, these mussels crowd out other competitors in a broad belt of the intertidal zone. By consuming mussels, sea star creates bare spaces that are taken over by a variety of other species.    A study at the University of Washington demonstrated the influence of Pisaster on species richness by removing sea stars from selected parts of the intertidal zone repeatedly over a period of five years. Two major changes occurred in the areas from  whichsea stars were removed. First, the lower edge of the mussel  bed  extended farther down into the intertidal zone, showing  that sea stars are able to eliminate mussels completely where they are covered with water most of the time. Second, and more dramatically, 28 species of animals and algae disappeared  from the sea star removal zone. Eventually only Mytilus, the dominant competitor, occupied the entire substratum. Through its effect on competitive relationships, predation by Pisaster largely determines which species live in these rocky intertidal ecosystems.",

The survival of sea stars is generally determined by the abundance of mussels.   Which of the statements given above is/are correct ?",

PASSAGE-1    Ecosystems provide people with a variety of goods and services; food, clean water, clean air, flood control, soil stabilization,pollination, climate regulation, spiritual fulfilment and aesthetic enjoyment, to name just a few. Most of these benefits either  are irreplaceable or the technology necessary to replace them is prohibitively expensive. For example, potable fresh water can  be provided by desalinating sea-water, but only at great cost.     The rapidly expanding human population has greatly modified the Earth's ecosystems to meet their increased requirements  of some of the goods and services, particularly food, fresh water, timber, fibre and fuel. These modifications have contributed substantially to human well being and economic development.The benefits have not been equally distributed. Some people have actually been harmed by these changes. Moreover, short-term increases in some ecosystem goods and services have come at the cost of the long-term degradation of  others. For example, efforts to increase the production of food and fibre have decreased the ability of some ecosystems to provide clean water, regulate flooding and support biodiversity.",

      "question_para": "Passage -2  It is essential that we mitigate the emissions of greenhouse gases and thus avoid some of the worst impacts of climate  change that would take place in coming years and decades. Mitigation would require a major shift in the way we produce and  consume energy. A shift away from overwhelming dependence on fossil fuels is now long overdue, but unfortunately, technological development has been slow and inadequate largely because government policies have not promoted investments in  research and development, myopically as a result of relatively low  prices of oil. It is now, therefore, imperative for a country like India  treating the opportunity of harnessing renewable energy on a large  scale as a national imperative. This country is extremely well  endowed with solar, wind and biomass sources of energy. Where we  have lagged, unfortunately, is in our ability to develop and to create technological solutions for harnessing these resources.   One particular trajectory for carryingout stringent  mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions assessed by the  Intergovernmental  Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) clearly shows the need for ensuring that global emissions of greenhouse gases peak  no later than 2015 and reduce rapidly thereafter. The cost  associated with such a trajectory is truly modest and would amount, in the estimation of IPCC, to not more than 3 percent of the global  GDP in 2030. In other words, the level of prosperity that the  world would have reached without mitigation would at worst be postponed by a few months or a year at the most. This is  clearly not a very high price to pay for protecting hundreds of  millions of people from the worst risks associated with climate change.  Any such effort, however, would require lifestyles to change appropriately also. Mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions  is not a mere technological fix, and clearly requires changes in lifestyles and transformation of a country's economic  structure, whereby effective reduction in   emissions is brought about, such as through the  consumption of much lower quantities of animal protein. The Food and  Agriculture Organization (FAO) has determined that the emissions from  the livestock sector amount to 18 percent of the total. The  reduction of emissions from this source is entirely in the hands of  human beings, who have never questioned the impacts that their  dietary habits of consuming more and more animal protein are  bringing about. Mitigation overall has huge co-benefits, such as  lower air pollution and health benefits, higher energy security and  greater   employment.",

Your answers to these items should be based  on the passages only.     Passage - 1   In recent times, India has grown fast not only compared to its own past but also incomparison with other nations. But there cannot be any room for complacency because it is possible for the Indian economy to develop even faster and also to spread the benefits of this growth more widely than has been done thus far. Before going into details of the kinds of micro-structural changes that we need to conceptualize and then proceed to implement, it is worthwhile    elaborating on the idea of inclusive growth that constitutes the defining concept behind this Government's various economic policies and decisions. A nation interested in inclusive growth views the same growth differently depending on whether the gains of the growth are heaped primarily on a small segment or shared widely by the population. The latter is cause for celebration but not the former. In other words, growth must not be treated as an end in itself but as an instrument for spreading prosperity to all. India's own past experience and the experience of other nations suggests that growth is necessary for eradicating poverty but it is not a sufficient condition. In other words, policies for promoting growth need to be complemented with policies to ensure that more and more people join in the growth process and, further, that there are mechanisms inplace to redistribute some of the gains to those who are unable to partake in the market process and, hence, get left behind.   A simple way of giving this idea of inclusive growth a sharper form is to measure a nation's progress in terms of the progress of its poorest segment, for instance the bottom 20 per cent of the population. One could measure the per capita income of the bottom quintile of the population and also calculate the growth rate of income; and evaluate our economic success in terms of these measures that pertain to the poorest segment. This approach is attractive because it does not ignore growth like some of the older heterodox criteria did. It simply looks at the growth of income of the poorest sections of the population. It also ensures that those who are outside of the bottom quintile do not get ignored. If that were done, then those people would in all likelihood drop down into the  bottom quintile and so would automatically become a direct target of our policies. Hence the criterion being suggested here is a statistical summing up of the idea of inclusive growth, which, in turn, leads to two corollaries : to wish that India must strive to achieve high growth and that we must work to ensure that the weakest segments benefit from the growth.",

Your answers to these items should be based  on the passages only.    Passage - 1  The Himalayan ecosystem is highly vulnerable to damage, both due to geological reasons and on account of the stress caused by increased pressure of population, exploitation of natural resources and other related challenges. These aspects may be exacerbated due to the impact of climate change. It is possible that climate change may adversely impact the Himalayan ecosystem  through increased temperature, altered precipitation patterns,  episodes of drought and biotic influences. This would not only impact the very sustenance of the indigenous communities in uplands  but also the life of downstream dwellers across the country and beyond. Therefore, there is an urgent need for giving special attention to sustain the Himalayan ecosystem. This would  require conscious efforts for conserving all the representative  systems.    Further, it needs to be emphasized that the endemics with restricted distribution, and most often with specialized habitat requirements, are among the most vulnerable elements. In  this respect the Himalayan biodiversity hotspot, with rich endemic diversity, is vulnerable to climate change. The threats include possible loss of genetic resources and species, habitats and concomitantly a decrease in ecosystem services. Therefore, conservation of endemic elements inrepresentative  ecosystems/ habitats assumes a great significance while drawing  conservation plans for the region.  Towards achieving the above, we will have to shift toward contemporary conservation approaches, which include a  paradigm of landscape level interconnectivity between protected area systems. The concept advocates a shift from the species- habitat focus to an inclusive focus on expanding the biogeographic  range  so that natural adjustments to climate change can proceed  without being restrictive.",

India faces a challenging immediate future in energy and climate policy-making. The problems are multiple: sputtering fossil fuel production capabilities; limited access to electricity and modern cooking fuel for the poorest; rising fuel imports in an unstable global energy context; continued electricity pricing and governance challenges leading to its costly deficits or surplus supply; and not least, growing environmental contestation around land, water and air. But all is not bleak: growing energy efficiency programmes; integrated urbanisation and transport policy discussion; inroads to enhancing energy access and security; and bold renewable energy initiatives, even if not fully conceptualised, suggest the promise of transformation.
