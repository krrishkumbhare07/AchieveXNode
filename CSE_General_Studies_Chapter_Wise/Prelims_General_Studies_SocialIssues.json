Your answers to these items should be based on the passage only.    PASSAGE   A species that exerts an influence out of proportion to its abundance in an ecosystem is called a keystone species. The keystone species may influence both the species richness of communities and the flow of energy and materials through ecosystems. The sea star Pisaster ochraceus, which lives in rocky intertidal ecosystems on the Pacific coast of North America, isalso an example of a keystone species. Its preferred prey is the mussel Mytilus californianus. In the absence of sea stars, these mussels crowd out other competitors in a broad belt of the intertidal zone. By consuming mussels, sea star creates bare spaces that are taken over by a variety of other species.    A study at the University of Washington demonstrated the influence of Pisaster on species richness by removing sea stars from selected parts of the intertidal zone repeatedly over a period of five years. Two major changes occurred in the areas from  whichsea stars were removed. First, the lower edge of the mussel  bed  extended farther down into the intertidal zone, showing  that sea stars are able to eliminate mussels completely where they are covered with water most of the time. Second, and more dramatically, 28 species of animals and algae disappeared  from the sea star removal zone. Eventually only Mytilus, the dominant competitor, occupied the entire substratum. Through its effect on competitive relationships, predation by Pisaster largely determines which species live in these rocky intertidal ecosystems.",

Your answers to these items should be based on the passage only.    PASSAGE   A species that exerts an influence out of proportion to its abundance in an ecosystem is called a keystone species. The keystone species may influence both the species richness of communities and the flow of energy and materials through ecosystems. The sea star Pisaster ochraceus, which lives in rocky intertidal ecosystems on the Pacific coast of North America, isalso an example of a keystone species. Its preferred prey is the mussel Mytilus californianus. In the absence of sea stars, these mussels crowd out other competitors in a broad belt of the intertidal zone. By consuming mussels, sea star creates bare spaces that are taken over by a variety of other species.    A study at the University of Washington demonstrated the influence of Pisaster on species richness by removing sea stars from selected parts of the intertidal zone repeatedly over a period of five years. Two major changes occurred in the areas from  whichsea stars were removed. First, the lower edge of the mussel  bed  extended farther down into the intertidal zone, showing  that sea stars are able to eliminate mussels completely where they are covered with water most of the time. Second, and more dramatically, 28 species of animals and algae disappeared  from the sea star removal zone. Eventually only Mytilus, the dominant competitor, occupied the entire substratum. Through its effect on competitive relationships, predation by Pisaster largely determines which species live in these rocky intertidal ecosystems.",

Such action would be moral, if we think it proper to act like a  machine and do so. For, in doing so, we use our discrimination. We  should bear in mind the distinction between acting mechanically and acting intentionally. It may be moral of a king to pardon a  culprit.    But the messenger carrying out the order of pardon plays only  a mechanical part in the king\u2019s moral act. But if the messenger  were to carry out the king\u2019s order considering it to be his duty, his action would be a moral one.

Adaptation and mitigation need to be integrated into a  climate-smart development strategy that increases resilience,  reduces the threat of further global warming, and improves development outcomes. Adaptation and mitigation measures can advance development, and prosperity can raise incomes and foster  better institutions. A healthier population living in better-built houses and with access to bank loans and social security is better equipped to deal with a changing climate and its  consequences.      Advancing robust, resilient development policies that promote adaptation is needed today because changes in the climate, already begun, will increase even in the short term.     The spread of economic prosperity has always been intertwined with adaptation to changing ecological conditions. But as growth has altered the environment and as  environmental change has accelerated, sustaining growth and adaptability demands greater capacity to understand our environment, generate new adaptive technologies and practices, and diffuse them widely. As economic historians have explained, much of humankind's creative potential has been directed at adapting  to the changing world. But adaptation cannot cope with all the impacts related to climate change, especially as larger changes unfold in the long term.   Countries cannot grow out of harm's way fast enough to match the changing climate. And some growth strategies,  whether driven by the government or the market, can also add to vulnerability \u2014 particularly if they overexploit natural  resources. Under the Soviet development plan, irrigated cotton  cultivation expanded in water-stressed Central Asia and led to the near disappearance of the Aral Sea, threatening the livelihoods of fishermen, herders and farmers. And clearing mangroves \u2014  the natural coastal buffers against storm surges \u2013 to make way for intensive farming or housing development , increases the  physical vulnerability of coastal settlements, whether in Guinea or in Louisiana.",

Very often FDI takes the form of a foreign corporation acquiring a domestic enterprise or  establishing a joint venture with one. By making such an acquisition the  foreign investor may substantially lessen competition and gain a dominant position in the relevant market, thus charging  higher prices. Another scenario is where the affiliates of two separate multinational companies (MNCs) have been established in competition with one another in a particular developing  economy, following the liberalization of FDI. Subsequently, the parent companies overseas merge. With the affiliates no longer  remaining independent, competition in the host country may be virtually eliminated and the prices of the products may be artificially inflated.    Most of these adverse consequences of mergers and acquisitions by MNCs can be avoided if an effective competition law is in place. Also, an economy that has implemented an effective competition law is in a better position to attract FDI than one that has not. This is not just because most MNCs are expected to be accustomed to the operation of such a law in their home countries and know how to deal with such concerns but also that MNCs expect competition authorities to ensure a level playing field between domestic and foreign firms .",

PASSAGE-1   The poor especially in market economies, need the strength that collectivities offer for creating more economic, social and political space for themselves, for enhancing their socio- economic well-being and voice, and as a protection against free market individualism. It has been argued that a group approach to  farming,  especially in the form of bottom up agricultural production collectivities, offers substantial scope for poverty alleviation  and empowering the poor as well as enhancing agricultural productivity. To realize this potential, however, the groups  would need to be voluntary in nature, small in size, participative indecision making and equitable in work sharing and benefit distribution. There are many notable examples of such collectivities to be found in varied contexts, such as in the transition economies.

These are  the States that got electricity, grew faster and now have high per capita income, making them capable of sharing India's burden  of becoming eco-friendly. Delhi, for example, can help by  generating its own clean electricity using solar rooftop panels or even help poor States finance their clean energy projects. It is no secret that State Electricity Boards, which control 95% of the distribution network, are neck-deep in losses. These losses further  discourage State utilities from adopting renewable energy as it is more expensive than fossil fuels.",

Groundwater is  also contaminated by open defecation. Many ingested germs and worms spread diseases. They prevent the body from  absorbing calories and nutrients. Nearly one-half of India's children  remain malnourished. Lakhs of them die from preventable conditions.   Diarrhoea leaves Indians' bodies smaller on average than  those of people in some poorer countries where people eat fewer  calories.    Underweight mothers produce stunted babies prone to  sickness who may fail to develop their full cognitive potential. The  germs released into environment harm rich and poor alike, even  those who use latrines.",

Discretionary powers to the administration can be done away with. It is becoming more and more difficult to keep this  power within limits as the government has many number of tasks to perform. Where discretion has to be used, there must be rules and safeguards to prevent misuse of that power. Systems  have to be devised which minimise, if not prevent, the abuse of discretionary power. Government work must be conducted   within a framework of recognised rules and principles, and decisions should be similar and predictable.",

Foresty and use, and land-use change account for another 17 percent of greenhouse gas emissions each year, three quarters of which come from tropical deforestation. The remainder is largely from draining and burning tropical peatland. About the same amount of carbon is stored in the world's peatlands as is stored in the Amazon rainforest.",

After humans began herding cattle, it became tremendously advantageous to digest milk, and lactose tolerance evolved independently among cattle herders in Europe, the middle East and Africa. Groups not dependant on cattle, such as the Chinese and Thai, remain lactose intolerant.",

In a a study, it was found that the soil, which contains twice the amount of carbon present in all plants and Earth's atmosphere combined, could become increasingly volatile as people add more carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. This is largely because of increased plant growth. Although a greenhouse gas and a pollutant, carbon dioxide also supports plant growth. As trees and other vegetation flourish in a carbon dioxide-rich future, their roots could stimulate microbial activity in soil that may in turn accelerate the decomposition of soil carbon and its release into the atmosphere as carbon dioxide.",

      "question_para": "PASSAGE-5    Historically, the biggest challenge to world agriculture has been to achieve a balance between demand for and supply of food. At the level of individual countries, the demand-supply balance can be a critical issue for a closed economy, especially if it is a populous economy and its domestic agriculture is not growing sufficiently enough to ensure food supplies, on an enduring basis; it is not so much and not always, of a constraint for an open, and growing economy, which has adequate exchange surplues to buy food abroad. For the world as a whole, Spply-demand balance is always an inescapable prerequisite for warding off hunger and starvation. However, global availability of adequate supply does not necessarily mean that food would automatically move from countries of surplus to counteries of deficit if the latter lack in purchasing power. The uneven distribution of Hunger, starvation, under or malnourishment, etc., at the world-level, thus owes itself to the presence of empty-pock hungry mouths, overwhelmingly confined to the underdeveloped economies. Inasmuch as 'a two-square meal' is of elemental significance to basic human existence, the issue of worldwide supply of food has been gaining significance, in recent times, both because the quantum and the composition of demand has been undergoing big changes, and because, in recent years, the capabilities individual countries to generate uninterrupted chain of food supplies have come under strain. Food production, marketing and prices, especially price-affordability by the poor in the developing world, have become global issues that need global thinking and global solutions.",

Devolution has been  characterized as being made up of three factors--political legitimacy, decentralization of authority and decentralization of  resources.   Political legitimacy here means a mass demand from below for the decentralization process, which is able to create a political  force for it to take place. In many cases, decentralization is initiated  by the upper tier of government without sufficient political mobilization for it at the grassroots level, and in such cases the decentralization process often does not fulfil its objectives.",

      "question_para": "PASSAGE-7  Many farmers use synthetic pesticides to kill infesting insects.    The consumption of pesticides in some of the developed  countries is touching 3000 grams/hectare. Unfortunately, there are  reports that these compounds possess inherent toxicities that  endanger the health of the farm operators, consumers and the  environment.    Synthetic pesticides are generally persistent in environment.    Entering in food chain they destroy the microbial diversity and cause ecologcal imbalance. Their indiscriminate use has  resulted in development of resistance among insects to insecticides, upsetting of balance in nature and resurgence of treated populations. Natural pest control using the botanical  pesticides is safer to the user and the environment because they break  down into harmless compounds within hours or days in the  presence of sunlight Plants with pesticidal properties have been in nature  for millions of years without any ill or adverse effects on the  ecosystem.    They are easily decomposed by many microbes common in   mostsoils. They help in the maintenance of biological diversity of predators and the reduction of environmental contamination  and human health hazards. Botanical pesticides formulated from  plants are biodegradable and their use in crop protection is a  practical sustainable alternative.",

This index is ideally kept constantly updated and available in different  places The AQI is most useful when lots of pollution data are being gathered and when pollution levels are normally, but not  always, low. In such cases, if pollution levels spike for a few days, the public can quickly take preventive action (like staying indoors)  in response to an air quality warning. Unfortunately, that is not  urban India. Pollution levels in many large Indian cities are so high  that they remain well above any health or regulatory standard for  large part of the year. If our index stays in the 'Red/Dangerous'  region day after day, there is not much any one can do, other than  getting  used to ignoring it.",

During hurricane 'Mitch'  in 1998, farms using ecoagricultural practices suffered 58 per  cent, 70 per cent and 99 per cent less damage in Honduras,  Nicaragua and Guatemala, respectively, than farms using conventional techniques. In Costa Rica, vegetative windbreaks and fencerows boosted farmers' income from pasture and coffee while also increasing bird diversity. Bee pollination is more effective when agricultural fields are closer to natural or seminatural habitat, a finding that matters because 87 per cent of the world's 107 leading crops depend on animal pollinators. In Costa Rica, Nicaragua and Colombia silvopastoral systems that integrate trees with pastureland are improving the sustainability of cattle production,  and diversifying and increasing farmers' income.",

Climate change will continue to affect weather conditions and create water shortages and excesses. While millions suffer from droughts and floods, waters in the country's many rivers flow unutilized, and are discharged into the sea every year.    With reference to the above passage, which of the following could be the most rational and practical implications for India?  1. Inter-linking of rivers should be undertaken.  2. A network of dams and canals should be built across the country for proper distribution of water.  3. Farmers should be provided easy loans for digging borewells.  4. Usage of water for agriculture should be regulated by law.  5. Distribution of river water among regions should be regulated by the Union Government.

Even those children who survive suffer permanently from the damage that has already been done to their bodies and minds from not getting enough of the right foods and nutrients. Around 44 million children under 5 are stunted. That makes it harder for them to learn in school and subsequently earn a living as adults. Their lifetime earnings potential is almost a quarter less than that of their healthy peers.

Equality is a relation that obtains between persons in respect of some fundamental characteristic that they share in common. Equality is, morally speaking, a default principle. Therefore, persons should not be discriminated on grounds such as race, caste, gender, ethnicity, disability, or class. These features of human condition are morally irrelevant. The idea that one should treat persons with respect not only because. some of these persons possess some special features or talent, for example skilled cricketers, gifted musicians, or literary giants, but because persons are human beings, is by now part of commonsense morality.With reference to the above passage, the following assumptions have been made :1. Equality is a prerequisite for people to participate in the multiple transactions of society from a position of confidence.2. Occurrence of inequality is detrimental to the survival of democracy.3. Equal standing of all citizens is an idea that cannot actually be realised even in a democracy.4. Right to equality should be incorporated into our values and day-to-day political vocabulary.Which of the above assumptions are valid?",
